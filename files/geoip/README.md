# GeoIP database: DB-IP "IP to Country Lite" (CC BY 4.0)

The platform user analytics resolves a client's country at WebSocket
connect time and then **drops the address**, so no IP is ever stored. That
lookup needs a MaxMind-format country database. The server image carries
one: DB-IP's **IP to Country Lite**, at
`/usr/share/roomler/geoip/dbip-country-lite.mmdb`, the path the image's
`ROOMLER__STATS__GEOIP_MMDB` names (#1896).

It is never committed. `scripts/fetch-geoip.sh` stages it in this
directory before `docker build`, and both image workflows run it
(`hosted-image.yml`, `publish-selfhost-image.yml`):

```bash
scripts/fetch-geoip.sh     # this month's release (or last month's), verified
docker build .             # COPY files/geoip/ bakes it in
```

The dashboard shows that link only when the server reports a DB-IP
database loaded (`geoip_database` in `/api/admin/stats/users`,
`ui/src/utils/geoipCredit.ts`). A deployment that supplies its own
database is credited by that database's own type, or not at all.

## Why DB-IP, and not GeoLite2

The image is a **public** package, so whatever it carries is redistributed
to everyone who pulls it. CC BY 4.0 permits that, given the credit above.
MaxMind's GeoLite End User License Agreement (updated 2026-02-12) does
not: §6 says you "will not disclose the Services to any third party
without notifying MaxMind of the anticipated disclosure and obtaining
MaxMind's prior written consent", and requires old versions to be destroyed
within 30 days of an update, which old image tags can never honour.
GeoLite2 therefore stays out of every published image. Before #1896 the
build host dropped `GeoLite2-Country.mmdb` here by hand; the GitHub lane
(FR-73) never did, which is why prod read every country as `unknown`.

## Your own database, or none

- **Your own** (a licensed GeoIP2 Country, or a GeoLite2 you are entitled
  to use): mount it and set `ROOMLER__STATS__GEOIP_MMDB=/path/to/it.mmdb`.
- **None**: set `ROOMLER__STATS__GEOIP_MMDB=` (empty). Lookups stop, and
  no warning is logged.
- ⚠️ An environment variable outranks `config/*.toml`, and the image sets
  this one. `[stats] geoip_mmdb` in a config file cannot override it; set
  the variable.

## Nothing breaks when it is absent

A build without the file (DB-IP unreachable during the build, or a source
build that skipped the script) produces an image whose analytics report
`country: unknown` and whose payload carries `geoip: false`, so the
dashboard says "no GeoIP database" rather than implying every user is in
one place. The fetch warns and the build goes on; the server logs one
warning at boot. That is the designed degradation, not an error.

Country granularity is what the analytics uses. City databases also exist
(much larger); adopting one would only make sense alongside a deliberate
decision to record finer-grained location, which is a privacy choice, not
a data-availability one.
