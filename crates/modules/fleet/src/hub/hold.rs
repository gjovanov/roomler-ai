//! FR-138 P1b-2 — the hub's half of a session that outlives its VIEWER's
//! socket (`docs/fr/FR-138-the-session-outlives-its-control-socket.md`
//! §4.4, "The controller's side stays in memory" and "A held session never
//! costs its own viewer the slot"; §4.5). The device's half is
//! [`super::resume`].
//!
//! * **The hold** ([`Hub::viewer_gone`]): a session its viewer may hold (told
//!   `resume_secs`, live, not external) on a device whose connection here
//!   still holds a window outlives the viewer's socket. The hub keeps it with
//!   no controller, tells the device nothing and writes nothing to the row,
//!   until the viewer rejoins or the window ends, when it ends as the socket's
//!   loss ended it before: `controller_hangup`, marked `limit: hold_expired`
//!   ([`LIMIT_HOLD_EXPIRED`]) so a reader can tell a resume its viewer never
//!   rejoined from a hangup.
//! * **The rejoin** ([`Hub::rejoin`]): the viewer's new socket is bound to the
//!   session. The caller has checked the row names that person and run the
//!   gate a request runs. A late call for the socket it replaced finds a
//!   different sender and changes nothing.
//! * **`replaces`** ([`Hub::end_replaced`]): a redial names the held session
//!   it gives up, which ends before every capacity gate when it names the
//!   same person and the same device. The remote module calls it, before it
//!   claims the org's slot for the redial.
//! * **The orphan reap** spares a held session only against another person's
//!   request ([`held_for_viewer`]), and never reads a session with no
//!   controller as an orphan. Its own person's request reaps it before the
//!   org's slot is claimed ([`Hub::reap_held_for`]).
//!
//! With the window at 0 no session is created resumable, so none of this
//! changes anything: a viewer's socket loss ends its sessions as it always
//! has.
