//! FR-138 — `GET` / `PUT /api/admin/rc-resume-scope`: the orgs and devices a
//! remote session may outlive its device's control socket on (spec §4.1, D4).
//!
//! A platform admin's list. Anyone else gets the 404 every `/api/admin/*`
//! route gives (`require_platform_admin`), and gets it before the body is
//! read, so a malformed body does not tell them the route exists either. The
//! GET answers the list beside `rc.session_resume_secs`, the window it is
//! announced under, so the operator reads both halves at once; the PUT
//! replaces the list and answers the GET's shape.
//!
//! The store lives here, in `fleet`, because the agent hub that reads it when
//! a device registers is fleet's: `remote` and `network` reach fleet, fleet
//! reaches neither, so no hook is needed.
//!
//! With the window at 0, the default, the server behaves as it did whatever
//! the list holds, and nothing reads it. From P1b-1 the agent socket reads it
//! at a device's registration ([`resume_hello`], through
//! [`RcResumeScopeDao::covers`](roomler_ai_services::dao::rc_resume_scope::RcResumeScopeDao::covers)),
//! for a device that advertises `rc-resume`; P1b-2 re-announces the window
//! when the list changes ([`scope_changed`]).
