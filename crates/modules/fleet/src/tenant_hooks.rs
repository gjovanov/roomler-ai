//! Fleet's side of the tenant cascade (FR-69 P7b): when an organization is
//! archived, every device's enrollment is revoked. The agent's long-lived JWT
//! stays cryptographically valid for its full year, so the row is the only
//! thing that can withdraw it — `soft_delete` is what every auth path already
//! checks. The archive route calls the core registry, which runs this after
//! the network module's release of the mesh (`HOOK_ORDER`).
