//! FR-138 P1b-2 — the sweep (`docs/fr/FR-138-the-session-outlives-its-control-socket.md`
//! §4.4, "The sweep"): what ends a session row whose end nobody saw, once no
//! device will ever claim it. One pod at a time, as the presence sweep runs
//! and on its cadence (`rc.presence_sweep_secs`): a per-cycle Redis claim
//! keyed by the database's name, its own key.
//!
//! | Rows it ends | When | Dated by |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | detached (`resume_by` set) and live past `resume_by` | at every window, 0 included: only a detach writes `resume_by`, so with the window at 0 from the start there are none, and a window turned back to 0 still ends what was detached before | `detached_at` |
//! | live with no `resume_by`, quiet for longer than the window, on a device in the resume scope that the presence sweep found offline for longer than the window: the pod that held it died without a word, and the device has not come back | only with the window on | `stats_at`, else `started_at` |
//!
//! Each end is `agent_disconnect` with `end_source: sweep`, written straight
//! to the row conditional on the row as the sweep read it: still live, at the
//! `attach_seq`, the `resume_by` and the `stats_at` read (a claim that resumed
//! it meanwhile bumps the one and clears the other; a session whose own clock
//! moved is alive), and recorded in the audit as its trail. The session's
//! FR-115 slot, which nobody renews once its session was detached, is given
//! back. A row outside the scope with no `resume_by` stays as it is, until
//! the scope reaches its device.
//!
//! The second kind is read a page a cycle (review 2, N7): the scope is read
//! once and asked of the query, so rows outside it never come back, and the
//! next cycle reads on after the page's last row ([`Cursor`]), so the rows it
//! keeps (a device online, a session this pod holds) never starve a newer
//! one. A device that was removed is gone for good (N6): its rows are
//! abandoned like those of a device offline.
