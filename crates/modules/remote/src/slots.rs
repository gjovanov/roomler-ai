//! FR-115 P3b — claiming a cluster-wide session slot before the hub creates
//! a session (`docs/fr/FR-115-pricing-reshape.md`, *P3b, as proposed*).
//!
//! The hub is synchronous and holds no Redis connection, so the claim runs
//! here, in the async caller on the pod that owns the device, and the hub is
//! handed the lease (`DispatchCtx::slot`, `create_session_full`'s `slot`).
//! From then on the hub renews it and gives it back when the session ends;
//! a slot that no session took is given back here ([`release_unused`]).
//!
//! Never refuse on a guess:
//! * when Redis cannot answer, a same-org request falls back to P3's count on
//!   the hub that owns the device, and an external one runs as it did before
//!   P3b (uncapped), counted in `rc_slot_claim_failed_total`;
//! * a full set whose holder THIS pod claimed but no longer holds is a stale
//!   lease (its release failed, or never ran): this pod is the one that would
//!   know, so it drops it and claims once more. That is what keeps a Free org
//!   from being locked out for a whole lease after a failed release, e.g. on
//!   its viewer's reconnect. Another pod's holders are never judged here.
//!   FR-138 (review 1, M5) — above window 0 a session no hub holds may be
//!   detached, waiting for its device's claim, and its lease is its slot: the
//!   holder's row is read first (once per such holder, only when the set is
//!   full), and the lease is dropped only when the row says the session is
//!   over (ended, not live, past its `resume_by`, or gone). At window 0
//!   nothing is read, as before.
