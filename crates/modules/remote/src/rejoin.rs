//! FR-138 P1b-2 — `rc:session.rejoin`, the viewer's claim on a session held
//! for it (`docs/fr/FR-138-the-session-outlives-its-control-socket.md` §4.4,
//! §4.5), answered on the pod the viewer's new socket reached.
//!
//! Each rejoin gets exactly one answer, and it names the session:
//! `rc:session.resumed`, `rc:session.detached {resume_by}` (ask again, in a
//! second, until `resume_by`), or `rc:terminate`. Never an `rc:error`: the
//! page asks again only after a `detached`, so a rejoin left unanswered
//! would hold it until its own deadline.
//!
//! | Where the session is | Answer |
//! |---|---|
//! | held by this pod's hub, for this person | the gate a request runs, again; then bound here and `rc:session.resumed`, or ended `admin_terminated` |
//! | the row names someone else, or nothing | `rc:terminate agent_disconnect`, the same as for no session: nothing leaks |
//! | the row is ended | `rc:terminate` with the row's own reason, except `controller_hangup`, answered `agent_disconnect` (`rejoin_end_reason`) |
//! | the row is live, and the gate refuses | written to the row as `admin_terminated`, and published, as an admin's end; `rc:terminate admin_terminated` |
//! | the gate cannot be run (a read failed) | nothing bound, nothing written: `rc:session.detached` with when the session ends if nobody claims it, so the viewer asks again |
//! | the row cannot be read | `rc:session.detached` with the window from now: the viewer asks again, and the first answer that reads the row brings its deadline in |
//! | detached by the device's side, inside `resume_by` | `rc:session.detached` with the row's `resume_by`: ask again |
//! | detached, past `resume_by` | `rc:terminate agent_disconnect` |
//! | live in the hub of the pod that holds the device's socket | relayed there (`rc.cmd`), bound there, answered through the relay |
//! | live, but in no hub yet (the claim is not answered, or a pod died without a word) | `rc:session.detached` with when it would end, or `rc:terminate agent_disconnect` once that has passed |
//!
//! Review 2, N14 — the gate costs about five reads, and a page asks every
//! second while its session waits for the device's claim. Where nothing is
//! bound or relayed (a detached row, a live row in no hub yet) the gate runs
//! at most once per 5 s per session and viewer ([`GateRuns`]), and a refusal
//! answers as the table says: a viewer removed from the org is refused
//! within about 5 s. Before a bind (held here) or a relay it always runs. A
//! pair's timing goes at its bind, its relay or its refusal, and the rest
//! are pruned at most once a second (PR D's review, LOW 8).
//!
//! With the window at 0 the rejoin is dropped unanswered, as a server before
//! FR-138 drops it. No page sends one then: none was told `resume_secs`.
