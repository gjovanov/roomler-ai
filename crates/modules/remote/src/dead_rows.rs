//! FR-138 P1b-2 — `POST /api/admin/rc-sessions/close-dead`: the one-time
//! close of the session rows a pod that died before FR-138 left open
//! (`docs/fr/FR-138-the-session-outlives-its-control-socket.md` §2.3, §10).
//! P0 counted 11 such rows on production, started 2026-08-12 to 10-31, each
//! on a device that has had a session since: 17,757.7 hours the growth
//! digest read as live. FR-138's registration read and sweep close the rows
//! a dying pod leaves from now on. This closes the ones from before.
//!
//! Platform operators only: anyone else gets the 404 every `/api/admin/*`
//! route gives, before the body is read. A dry run by default, which lists
//! what a real run would close and writes nothing. Paged by `limit` and
//! `after` (the answer's `next`), and idempotent: a second run finds nothing
//! left.
//!
//! **The proof of death** (review 2, N1). A live session is held in the hub
//! of the pod that holds its device's control socket, and nowhere else. So
//! a row is dead when all of these hold:
//!
//! | Check | Why |
//! |---|---|
//! | live (Active, no `ended_at`) and created more than `min_age_hours` ago (24 by default, 1 at least) | a live session younger than that is someone's |
//! | its own clock has not moved since: no `stats_at`, or one that old | a live session's stats land about every 15 s while `stats.enabled` is on, which a real run requires |
//! | no hub on this pod holds it | a session this pod runs is not dead |
//! | its device has a session row created after it, in its org | the device came back and was used since |
//! | its device is offline everywhere; or its socket is on this pod, whose hub does not hold the session; or it is on another pod, which answers that its hub does not hold the session (`rc.session_held`) | the only place a live session can be is the hub of its device's pod |
//!
//! Anything this pod cannot read (the device's presence, another pod's
//! answer) keeps the row, and says so. Every row read is answered with its
//! evidence: dead rows in `rows`, the others in `kept` with the reason.
//!
//! A real run is refused while `stats.enabled` is off: no row's own clock
//! moves then, so a live session looks as quiet as a dead one. It ends each
//! dead row as `agent_disconnect`, dated by the row's own last clock
//! (`crate::resume::inferred_end`: `detached_at`, else `stats_at`, else
//! `started_at`, else `created_at`; never the operator's clock, so it adds no
//! hours) and marked `end_source: backfill`. Each write is conditional on the
//! row as it was read (still live, at the fencing number, the `resume_by`
//! and the `stats_at` read) and on its creation before the cut-off.
