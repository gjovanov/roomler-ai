//! FR-138 — the server's answer to a device that comes back for the sessions
//! it kept (`docs/fr/FR-138-the-session-outlives-its-control-socket.md`
//! §4.4), run in this module's agent-socket `hello`, before the socket's read
//! loop starts. Only for a connection announced a window: with the window at
//! 0, or a device outside the scope or without `rc-resume`, nothing here runs
//! and nothing is read.
//!
//! **The claim.** For each session the hello names, the pod the device
//! reached decides from the session's ROW, never from any pod's memory:
//!
//! | Check | Fails as |
//! |---|---|
//! | the row exists in the device's tenant and names this device | `agent_disconnect`, nothing written |
//! | the row is live and not ended | the row's own end reason (an admin's end written during the gap reads `admin_terminated`), nothing written |
//! | `resume_by` has not passed, when the row has one | `agent_disconnect`, the row ended as inferred |
//! | the gate a request runs, run again (`controller::resume_gate`) | `admin_terminated`; a read that failed decides nothing: `agent_disconnect`, and the session is over, so the device's newest connection ends the row as inferred |
//! | the org's maximum length, counted from `started_at` | `idle_timeout`, limit `max_duration` |
//! | the FR-115 slot, taken again under the session's own id | `agent_disconnect` |
//!
//! A claim that passes commits with one conditional update that bumps the
//! fencing number ([`RemoteSessionDao::commit_resume`]); the hub rebuilds the
//! session and counts it; the row is read once more, so an end that landed
//! meanwhile wins; and only then does the device hear `rc:session.resumed`.
//! Consent is the one check not re-run. A commit that matched nothing is
//! decided from the row read again (`commit`): the device's NEWEST
//! connection tries once more at the row's number while the row is still
//! live and inside its window (an older connection's claim of the same
//! device committed first), or ends the row it refuses; an older
//! connection's claim does neither, and leaves the slot alone.
//!
//! **The registration read.** Then every live row of the device created
//! before this registration that the hello does not claim (and the hub did
//! not just reap) is ended as `agent_disconnect`, dated by the row's own last
//! clock ([`inferred_end`]) and marked `end_source: registration`, fenced at
//! the number read. That is what closes a row a pod that died left open.
