//! FR-52 P3c — the server's half of an external-access login: a BLIND relay.
//!
//! An outsider's browser and a device run an OPAQUE login through this pod. The
//! server resolves the connect code, applies the two gates it owns (the org's
//! switch, the per-device approval), forwards the three login messages, and
//! learns nothing it could use: not the password, nothing to attack offline, no
//! proof it could replay. The device verifies; the server only carries.
//!
//! # Two rules that shape every function here
//!
//! 1. **One answer for every refusal the outsider must not tell apart** —
//!    [`ExtauthRefusal::Unavailable`] for no-such-code, gate 1 off, gate 2
//!    closed or expired, offline, too old. The org's audit log is where they
//!    are told apart (`login_detail`); the outsider never sees the difference.
//!    And the same LATENCY as far as that is cheap to buy: the reply goes out
//!    BEFORE the audit write (a write only resolvable codes trigger), and an
//!    unresolvable code still pays the tenant read a resolvable one does.
//! 2. **Park before the push.** The device can answer faster than this
//!    function gets back from `send_to_agent`; the waiter is registered first,
//!    so an early answer finds somewhere to land (FR-83's rule).
//!
//! # Across pods (P3d)
//!
//! An outsider has no tenant, so tenant affinity cannot put their socket on the
//! pod that holds the device, and roughly half of them land elsewhere. Both
//! controller frames carry the connect code rather than an agent id so the pod
//! they land on can re-resolve it and, when the device is not here, forward the
//! raw frame ONCE over the PR-2 rc relay ([`Hop`]). The owner pod handles it
//! with the relay's proxy sender, whose replies route back to the browser's own
//! connection. `finish` resolves the code BEFORE the attempt table for the same
//! reason: an attempt started cross-pod lives on the other pod.
//!
//! # The session (P4)
//!
//! A VERIFIED login is kept here, single-use, for [`VERIFIED_TTL`], and
//! `rc:extauth.session` spends it: the server proves the login was verified on
//! THIS pod, for THIS principal and THIS device, re-checks gates 1 and 2, clamps
//! the grant to the org's ceiling, and asks the Hub for a session whose
//! `rc:request` names the login. It decides nothing else — the device binds the
//! session to that login or refuses it, asks its own consent, applies its own
//! ceiling, and checks the offer's MAC (`agents/roomlerd/src/extauth.rs`). What
//! the server holds here is a bookkeeping entry, not a credential: without the
//! device's key it can neither open the session nor impersonate either end.
