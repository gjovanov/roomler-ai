// This whole module IS the legacy-segment fallback. Every occurrence of a
// retired name in it is the OLD half of a dual-read — the module doc explaining
// the new-then-old resolution, `OLD_APP`, `migrate_legacy_trees`, and the tests
// that build a legacy tree in order to migrate it.
// INVARIANT: if you add a retired name here that is NOT the old half of a
// dual-read, that is a bug, not a new exemption. docs/fr/FR-21
//! Roomler node application directories with a legacy-segment fallback.
//!
//! The controlled-host daemon is being renamed `roomler-agent` -> `roomlerd`
//! (the unified device/node model — see the unification plan). Its per-user and
//! machine-global data trees historically live under an app segment
//! `roomler-agent` (`%APPDATA%\roomler\roomler-agent`,
//! `%PROGRAMDATA%\roomler\roomler-agent`, `~/.config/roomler-agent`, ...).
//!
//! Renaming that segment to `roomler` must **never** orphan a host's enrolled
//! `config.toml` (its bearer token) — that's the same class of silent
//! fleet-drop-off as the MajorUpgrade-drops-env-vars bug. So resolution reads
//! BOTH: it uses the NEW `roomler` segment when its tree already exists, else
//! keeps using the OLD `roomler-agent` tree if THAT exists, and only a genuinely
//! fresh install lands on the new segment. The decision is made once per process
//! (cached) and applied to every directory, so config / logs / crashes on a host
//! never split across two trees.
//!
//! S1b adds the follow-up: [`migrate_legacy_trees`] performs a one-shot
//! startup RENAME of the legacy trees onto the `roomler` segment (per-user
//! config/data roots + the Windows machine-global root). It runs before any
//! consumer caches a segment decision, never deletes, and on any failure
//! simply leaves the read-both resolution in charge (retry next start) — so
//! enrollment still cannot be lost.
