//! FR-84 D4 — `files_dir`: where files dropped onto a remote-control session
//! land on this device, and the rules that make it safe to let a person set.
//!
//! ## Why a folder setting is a security control here
//!
//! The daemon writes dropped files as WHATEVER IDENTITY IT RUNS UNDER — on a
//! machine-wide Windows install that is `LocalSystem`, inside the interactive
//! user's session. And the LocalAPI that carries `ConfigSet` admits every
//! interactive user: the pipe's SDDL grants `IU`
//! (`crates/localapi/src/lib.rs`, `LOCALAPI_SDDL`), so a non-admin at the
//! keyboard can drive the verb. Without a rule, that person could point
//! `files_dir` at `C:\Windows\…` and have SYSTEM write remote-supplied bytes
//! there on the next drop. Hence three checks, in this order:
//!
//! 1. **Shape** — absolute, or `~`-relative; no device / kernel-namespace
//!    paths (`\\?\`, `\\.\`, `\??\`, `\Device\`, anything naming
//!    `GLOBALROOT`); no administrative or device UNC shares (`\\host\C$`,
//!    `\\host\ADMIN$`, `\\host\pipe`, `\\host\IPC$`); no `..` component;
//!    on Windows no component the OS would silently rewrite (a trailing dot
//!    or space — `C:\Windows.\Temp` IS `C:\Windows\Temp`) or read as
//!    something other than a folder name (`name:stream`).
//! 2. **Placement** — never under a system root (`%WINDIR%`,
//!    `%ProgramFiles%`, `%ProgramFiles(x86)%`; `/etc`, `/usr`, `/bin`,
//!    `/sbin`, `/System`, `/Library`, …) and — **when the writer is SYSTEM or
//!    root** — inside the ACTIVE user's profile. `~` expands against that
//!    same profile at USE time, so one machine-global config stays right for
//!    whoever is logged in.
//! 3. **Reality** — the folder must exist or be creatable, and be writable (a
//!    probe file is written and removed). Junctions and symlinks are followed
//!    before the placement rule is re-checked, so a link inside the profile
//!    that points at `C:\Windows` is refused too — and for a privileged
//!    writer a path whose real location cannot be determined is refused
//!    rather than assumed to be where it is spelled.
//!
//! The same validator runs at SET time (the daemon refuses a `ConfigSet` it
//! would not honour, with the reason verbatim) and at USE time (every drop
//! re-validates the configured value and falls back to the default folder with
//! a warning). **Use time is the load-bearing gate**: the desktop's
//! direct-file fallback and a hand edit write the config AS THE USER, with no
//! daemon in the path to refuse.
//!
//! `config_surface::apply` runs only the SHAPE check ([`check_shape`]) — it has
//! no writer identity and must not touch the disk. The daemon owns placement
//! and reality ([`validate`]), and reports the effective folder on
//! `NodeStatus.files_dir`.
//!
//! Everything but [`ensure_writable`] and the on-disk re-check is pure string
//! work parameterised on [`Rules::windows`], so the Windows rules are
//! unit-tested on every CI host and the Unix rules on Windows.
