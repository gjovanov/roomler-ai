//!   pre-rename host keeps `\roomler-agent\` there — see
//!   `appdirs::app_segment`).
//! - The future admin UI heartbeat (resilience plan Phase 7) can
//!   surface "this agent flagged itself as needing attention."
//! - An interactive operator running `roomlerd re-enroll`
//!   sees the file vanish on success.
//!
//! Real OS-toast notification (BurntToast on Win, `notify-send` on
