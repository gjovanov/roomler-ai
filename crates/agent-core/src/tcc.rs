//! macOS TCC (privacy-permission) probes.
//!
//! macOS never *errors* when a permission is missing — CGDisplayStream
//! happily delivers wallpaper-only frames without Screen Recording, and
//! CGEventPost silently swallows events without Accessibility. Both read
//! as product bugs ("black screen", "input does nothing") with nothing in
//! the logs. These probes exist so the agent SAYS what the OS will not.
//!
//! The grants are keyed on the binary's code signature (an ad-hoc cdhash
//! for the unsigned builds), so a binary update can invalidate them — on
//! the next start these fire again and name the fix.
