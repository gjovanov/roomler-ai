//! Roomler-SSH session activity (`ssh_activity`, P8).
//!
//! What a device REPORTS doing inside a session: the commands it ran, the
//! shells and SFTP subsystems it opened, the forwards it allowed or refused.
//!
//! Deliberately a different collection from `ssh_audit`, and the distinction
//! is the whole point of the design:
//!
//! | | `ssh_audit` | `ssh_activity` |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | written by | the SERVER, from its own decision | the DEVICE, reporting |
//! | authority | authoritative | a claim by a host that may be compromised |
//! | answers | who was ALLOWED in | what they did once inside |
//!
//! Folding them together would leave a reader unable to tell which rows the
//! server stands behind. Correlate across the two on `grant_id`.
//!
//! ⚠️ **No rows is not proof of no activity.** Reporting is off by default
//! (`ssh_activity_log`), and a compromised host can simply stop talking. The
//! grant record in `ssh_audit` is what survives a lying device.
//!
//! Content is deliberately absent — no pty byte stream, no command output.
//! Recording those would ship whatever the operator typed, passwords included,
//! off the host; see `SshActivityEvent`. Writes are best-effort and must never
//! gate a session. Rows TTL out after 90 days (`crates/db/src/indexes.rs`).
