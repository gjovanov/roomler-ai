//! FR-19 peer-relay decision log (`peer_relay_audit`).
//!
//! Two decisions land here, both arms of each: an admin's APPROVAL of a device
//! as an org relay (`routes::peer_relay::set_policy`) and the server's MINT of
//! a relay session between two nodes (`ws::overlay`, P3c). The refused rows
//! are the point — an admin probing which devices they can turn into a
//! chokepoint, or a node probing which peers it can reach through one, must
//! leave a trace.
//!
//! ⚠️ A mint row records the DECISION, never the session: the server pushes a
//! session to three devices and its involvement ends there. Bytes relayed are
//! the relay device's own account of itself (`NodeStatus`) — a claim — and are
//! deliberately not folded in here, the same split as `ssh_audit` /
//! `ssh_activity`.
//!
//! ⚠️ With `peer_relay_mode = off` NOTHING is written: the acceptance
//! criterion is zero rows, so the mint checks the mode before it audits.
//!
//! Writes are best-effort and must never gate the request; the caller logs a
//! failed insert and proceeds. Rows TTL out after 90 days
//! (`crates/db/src/indexes.rs`), matching the other decision logs.
