//! What a device REPORTS about a recording made from a remote-control
//! session: the host's answer to the just-in-time prompt, the start, the stop
//! (size, length, why), a download. The same split `ssh_activity` makes
//! against `ssh_audit`:
//!
//! | | `remote_audit` (`SessionRequested`) | `recording_activity` |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | written by | the SERVER, from its own decision | the DEVICE, reporting |
//! | authority | authoritative | a claim by a host that may be compromised |
//! | answers | was `RECORD` granted, and if not why | what the host then did |
//!
//! Correlate on `session_id`. ⚠️ No rows is not proof that nothing was
//! recorded — a compromised host can stay silent; the grant in `remote_audit`
//! is what survives it. Never content: the recording itself stays on the
//! device. Rows TTL out after 90 days (the `remote` module's index plan).
