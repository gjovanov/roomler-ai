//! Consent flow.
//!
//! When a controller requests a session, the server creates a oneshot channel
//! and stores its sender in the session's pending state. The agent receives
//! `rc:request`, prompts the user, and replies with `rc:consent`. The server
//! resolves the oneshot. If the agent doesn't reply within the timeout, the
//! server resolves with `Timeout` and tears down the session.
//!
//! FR-27 — a `granted: false` is not one thing. "The person at the machine
//! pressed Deny", "the prompt stood there and nobody answered" and "no surface
//! on that host could raise a prompt at all" have different causes and
//! different fixes, and collapsing them was actively misleading: the agent's
//! own prompt timeout produced `granted: false`, which the hub terminated as
//! `UserDenied`, so the controller was told a human had refused them when in
//! fact nobody had been asked. [`ConsentDenyReason`] rides `rc:consent`
//! alongside `granted` so the three stay distinguishable end to end.
