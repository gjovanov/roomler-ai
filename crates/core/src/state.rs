//! FR-69 P1 — the server core, split out of the api crate's `AppState`.
//!
//! `Core` holds the 27 fields every pillar needs and no pillar owns: identity
//! and tenancy (users, tenants, roles, invites, auth), notifications and
//! their channels (email, push, OAuth), storage, the `/ws` socket registry and
//! its Redis fan-out, the cluster identity/directory/bus, TURN credentials
//! and relay load, the metering sink, and the background-task service.
//! The host's `AppState` keeps a `Core` as its first field and **derefs to
//! it**, so every `state.settings` / `state.users` / `state.db` in the tree
//! reads exactly as before — the split changes ownership, not call sites.
//!
//! The handler-side seam is `State<Core>`: a handler that needs only the
//! core takes it instead of the host state, which is what the module crates
//! take from P2 on. The `FromRef<AppState> for Core` impl that makes the
//! extractor work while the router's state is still `AppState` lives in the
//! api crate (the orphan rules put it next to `AppState`); this crate never
//! learns that type exists.
//!
//! P1a introduced the split inside the api crate; P1b moved the type here
//! unchanged, together with the modules that hold its fields
//! ([`crate::ws`], [`crate::cluster`], [`crate::storage`],
//! [`crate::user_analytics`], [`crate::rate_limit`], [`crate::relay_load`]).
