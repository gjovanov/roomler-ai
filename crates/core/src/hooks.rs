//! The inverse edges (FR-69 D6): what a module does when core — or the
//! module that owns a record — tells it that record is going away.
//!
//! The call graph is a DAG (`conference → chat`, `remote → fleet`,
//! `network → fleet`), so the module that OWNS a record can never call the
//! modules that hold state about it: fleet cannot ask network to release an
//! overlay lease, or remote to terminate a session. Those flows exist today
//! as direct calls inside the host; here they are **typed hook traits**,
//! registered at composition time and invoked in [`HOOK_ORDER`] — session
//! holders → lease holders → the record owner — by whoever runs the cascade.
//!
//! Hooks must be idempotent: a cascade can be re-run after a crash mid-way
//! (already true of the code they replace). A hook a profile does not
//! compile is simply not registered, and the cascade skips it.
//!
//! # Registry
//!
//! [`HookRegistry`] lives on `Core` (`core.hooks`) and is shared through
//! every `Core` clone, so a module built BEFORE the host finished composing
//! still sees the hooks registered after it. The host registers each mounted
//! module's [`Module::hooks`](crate::Module::hooks) under the module's id; until
//! a module is extracted, the host registers its own implementation of that
//! module's hooks under the same id (the transitional shape P5a introduced —
//! the network steps of the agent cascade run from host code, but through
//! this registry, in this order).
