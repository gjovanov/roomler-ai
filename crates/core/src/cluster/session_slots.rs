//! FR-115 P3b — remote-session slots: a cluster-wide count of the concurrent
//! remote sessions an org (or an account in no org) runs, kept in Redis on
//! the cluster directory's own discipline (`directory.rs`). Redis is a
//! directory here, not a database: every record can be re-derived from the
//! live hubs, a reader fails soft, and a TTL backs up every release.
//!
//! * One sorted set per payer, `roomler:rc:slots:{db}:{org|user}:{id}`:
//!   member = session id, score = lease expiry (ms).
//! * One hash per session, `roomler:rc:slot:{db}:{session}`: the holder (user
//!   and device), which the refusal names.
//!
//! The hub that holds a session renews its lease every [`SLOT_RENEW_SECS`];
//! a lease lives [`SLOT_TTL_SECS`]. A pod that dies stops renewing, and its
//! slots free themselves within a lease. A Redis restart loses the sets, and
//! the next renewal round puts back every session its hub still holds
//! ([`SessionSlots::restore`]). Renewal itself only updates (`ZADD XX`), so a
//! session released while a round was in flight is never put back, and only
//! lengthens (`GT` on the score, Redis 6.2, and on both keys' expiry, Redis
//! 7.0: the floor), so a round in flight never shortens a lease FR-138 kept.
//!
//! FR-138 (review 1, L5) — a detached session is held by no pod, so nobody
//! renews its lease through the gap. The detach keeps it once, in Redis,
//! until the session's `resume_by` plus [`SLOT_KEEP_PAST_RESUME_MS`]
//! ([`SessionSlots::keep`]): a window longer than what was left of the lease
//! (up to 120 s against 60-90 s) no longer loses the slot, and the pod that
//! detached the session may die meanwhile. Every writer only lengthens a key's
//! expiry (PR D's review, LOW 5): the claim reads `PTTL` before it writes one,
//! and a restore writes `PEXPIRE … NX`, then `GT`. So another session's claim
//! in the org, or a restore after Redis lost a lease, never takes a kept lease
//! away with its set before its deadline, at any window up to the 120 s cap.
//! A keep never revives a lease that has already lapsed (LOW 7).
//!
//! The holder record names the claiming pod. A caller refused by a full set
//! may drop a holder that ITS OWN pod claimed but no longer holds (a release
//! that failed): that pod is the one that would know. It never judges another
//! pod's holders (`roomler_ai_mod_remote::slots`).
//!
//! The claim is ONE Lua script (drop expired, already mine → renew, under the
//! cap → add, else full), so two starts in the same instant cannot both pass
//! (the count/insert race P3's hub count documents). The member is the
//! session id, so a retried claim for the same session renews it rather
//! than spending a second slot.
