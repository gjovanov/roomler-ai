//! Tunnel-client **session driver** — the reusable engine behind the CLI's
//! `forward`/`socks5`/`mesh` and (P3b-2) the daemon's outbound tunnels.
//!
//! P3b-1 landed the shared **flow vocabulary** here — the per-flow
//! reply-correlation types + the open-timeout. P3b-1b folds in the session
//! orchestration itself (moved from `roomler::forward`) behind the
//! [`crate::signaling_link`] seam: [`run_tunnel_session`] speaks the
//! `rc:tunnel.*` control protocol over a cloneable
//! [`TunnelSignalingSink`](crate::signaling_link::TunnelSignalingSink) + a
//! single-consumer
//! [`TunnelSignalingSource`](crate::signaling_link::TunnelSignalingSource)
//! instead of owning a WebSocket, so the SAME engine serves the CLI (WS-backed)
//! and — at P3b-2 — the `roomlerd` daemon (agent-WS-multiplexer-backed).
//!
//! FR-86 P1 split a session into **establishment** and **carrying**:
//! [`establish_tunnel_session`] does the hello/open, the transport handshake
//! and brings the data plane to ready — everything a session used to do up to
//! (not including) binding its loopback listener — and returns a [`Carrier`],
//! which runs the per-connection code the session's accept loop used to run.
//! Who owns the port is the caller's choice: [`run_tunnel_session`] (the
//! standalone CLI) binds one per session as before; the daemon's flow binds
//! once for its whole life ([`crate::flow_listener`]) and installs each
//! carrier behind it, so a reconnect no longer refuses connections and — the
//! reason for the split — a second carrier can be established beside the
//! first (P2's make-before-break re-upgrade).
