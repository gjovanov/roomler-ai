//! The **signaling seam** the tunnel-session driver rides.
//!
//! [`crate::driver::run_tunnel_session`] speaks the `rc:tunnel.*` control
//! protocol over this pair instead of owning a WebSocket, so the SAME driver
//! serves both the `roomler-tunnel` CLI (which backs it with a tokio-tungstenite
//! WS carrying a `TunnelClient` JWT) and — at P3b-2 — the `roomlerd` daemon
//! (which backs it with its existing agent-WS multiplexer + a per-session
//! `ServerMsg` channel). The split into a cloneable **sink** + a single-consumer
//! **source** maps 1:1 onto how `forward.rs` already worked: an
//! `mpsc::Sender<ClientMsg>` fanned into every per-flow task, and one owned
//! `SplitStream` moved from the setup wait into the dispatch loop.
