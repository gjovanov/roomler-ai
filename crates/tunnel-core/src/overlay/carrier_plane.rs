//! Multi-org v2 — the process-wide shared direct-carrier plane.
//!
//! Today every org runtime binds its own direct sockets off the SAME
//! process-global stable port ([`direct::direct_port`]), deconflicted only by
//! the blind band walk — so which org holds the base is a spawn-order race
//! that re-runs on every restart and rebuild, churning the NAT mappings of
//! every org that loses it (field: CORPLAP-1's second org re-punching after
//! each restart). The plane replaces that with ONE socket set for the whole
//! process: every attached engine (one per org) sends and receives on the
//! same stable `ip:port`, and inbound datagrams are demultiplexed by the
//! WireGuard **receiver index** instead of by source address.
//!
//! Why the index and not the source: with N orgs sharing one socket pair on
//! BOTH hosts, two independent sessions (org A's and org B's) arrive from the
//! SAME remote `ip:port` — a source-keyed table cannot tell them apart (the
//! `wg.rs` `DemuxRoutes` insert is last-write-wins). The receiver index can:
//! boringtun derives each session's on-wire index from the `index` passed to
//! `Tunn::new` (`local_index = index << 8`; rekeys walk only the low 8 bits),
//! so `receiver_idx >> 8` is a stable per-session key — provided indices are
//! unique across ALL engines, which is exactly what [`PlaneHandle::alloc_index`]
//! provides.
//!
//! Handshake INITIATIONS carry no receiver index (the peer doesn't know our
//! session yet), so they route the way WireGuard itself routes them — by
//! static key: the plane tries [`wg::authenticate_init_with`] against each
//! attached engine (N ≤ a handful, and only on handshakes). An init from a
//! source the authenticated engine already has a session with is processed on
//! that session's `Tunn` (the rekey path); anything else is forwarded to that
//! engine's [`DirectInbound`] channel exactly as the per-device demux did —
//! same rate limit, same runtime-side accept path.
//!
//! One plane per process, owned by the embedder (the agent holds it in a
//! static beside the TUN cache). Engines attach with [`CarrierPlane::attach`];
//! the returned [`PlaneHandle`] is the engine's capability to allocate
//! indices and register routes, and detaches on drop. Gated by
//! `OVERLAY_SHARED_CARRIER` at the embedder — nothing in this module reads
//! the flag.
