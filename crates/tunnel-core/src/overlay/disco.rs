//! Disco — the out-of-tunnel carrier echo (C1: responder only).
//!
//! # Why this exists, and why it is NOT the rc.346 data-probe
//!
//! Measuring whether a *path* delivers data is the one thing the liveness
//! stack could never do honestly. Every passive signal is indirect: WG
//! handshakes are small and retried, so they complete over a path that drops
//! most bulk data (field 2026-08-11: `tx=122 rx=58`, `ping` 100 % loss, and
//! the carrier still looked healthy to every reaper).
//!
//! rc.346 tried to fix that with an **in-tunnel** probe — an inner ICMP /
//! marked IP packet that the PEER'S OS or overlay engine had to answer. That
//! made the measurement depend on the peer's operating system, its firewall,
//! and a capability negotiation, and it shipped default-ON in the same release
//! that introduced the responder, so nothing in the fleet could answer yet: it
//! demoted healthy 0 ms carriers within minutes.
//!
//! Disco is the Tailscale-shaped correction. It rides **outside** the WG
//! tunnel, as its own datagram shape on the carrier socket the two daemons
//! already share, and it is answered **unconditionally by the daemon** — no
//! OS, no firewall rule, no tunnel session, no capability bit. It measures the
//! PATH, not the peer's host stack.
//!
//! # Deployment rule this module encodes
//!
//! **A prober that punishes non-answer must ship at least one release AFTER
//! the responder is fleet-wide.** C1 therefore ships the responder ONLY —
//! this node answers pings, and asks nothing. Nothing reads the answers yet.
//! The prober (C2) and scoring (C3) come later, once every peer can reply.
//!

//    cannot answer simply never wins that path, instead of being punished.

//    reaper counted consecutive misses and could therefore only catch a
//    FULLY dead path: on the live grox carrier (~20 % delivery, `tx=17..22
//    rx=3..4`) roughly one probe in five got through and reset the counter,
