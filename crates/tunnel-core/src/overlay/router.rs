//! Overlay crypto-routing table.
//!
//! boringtun's [`Tunn`](boringtun::noise::Tunn) is **single-peer** — it
//! has no notion of `allowed_ips`. The mesh's routing therefore lives
//! here: a map from a peer's overlay address to its WireGuard public
//! key. Because every overlay peer is advertised with a single-host
//! `allowed_ips` (its `overlay_ip/32`), this is an exact-match
//! `HashMap<Ipv4Addr, [u8; 32]>` rather than a longest-prefix trie.
//!
//! Outbound path: read the destination address out of the IP packet
//! header → [`Router::route`] → the peer's pubkey → the peer's `Tunn`.
//!
//! **IPv6 (dual-stack)**: a node's overlay v6 is *derived* from its overlay
//! v4 — the v4 embedded in the low 32 bits of Roomler's ULA `/96`
//! ([`derive_overlay_v6`], `docs/netstack-ipv6-plan.md`). Routing therefore
//! needs **no v6 table**: [`Router::dst_of_ip_packet`] unmaps a derived-ULA
//! destination back to its embedded v4 and routes on the existing v4 entries,
//! covering every present and future peer with zero per-peer state and zero
//! netmap change. A v6 destination outside the ULA (link-local/multicast OS
//! noise, genuine internet v6) is unroutable by construction and dropped.
