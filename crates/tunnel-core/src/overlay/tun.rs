//! L3 TUN surface for the overlay (Phase 3).
//!
//! [`TunIo`] is the seam between the WireGuard bridge ([`super::bridge`])
//! and the OS virtual NIC. Production uses [`SystemTun`] (the `tun` crate
//! → Wintun on Windows, `/dev/net/tun` on Linux, utun on macOS), behind
//! the `overlay-l3` feature; tests use an in-memory mock, so the bridge
//! is exercised end-to-end with no kernel driver and no privilege.
//!
//! Routing note: a node brings the device up with its own overlay IP and
//! the *network* netmask (e.g. `100.64.0.3` / `255.192.0.0` for a `/10`),
//! which makes the whole overlay CIDR on-link via this interface — the OS
//! installs the connected route automatically on Linux + Windows, so
//! there is no explicit route-table call here. Per-peer reachability is
//! still exact-match `/32` in [`super::router::Router`]; a packet to an
//! overlay address with no installed peer is dropped by
//! [`super::wg::WgDevice::send_ip_packet`]. (macOS utun is point-to-point
//! and may need an explicit `route add` for the CIDR — refined when 3b/3c
//! field-test there.)
//!
//! Dual-stack: the device also carries the node's *derived* overlay IPv6
//! ([`super::router::derive_overlay_v6`]) on the ULA `/96`, assigned
//! best-effort at bring-up — the connected `/96` route makes every peer's
//! derived v6 on-link, and the WG bridge routes those packets by unmapping
//! the ULA destination to its embedded v4 (no v6 route table anywhere).
