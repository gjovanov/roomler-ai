//! Coturn-relay carrier coordination for the overlay runtime (Phase 3b).
//!
//! **Deterministic worker (rc.127).** The relay-to-relay leg must hairpin on
//! ONE coturn worker: cross-worker relay traffic drops under mars's
//! dual-public-IP SNAT (the issue the QUIC tunnel fixed in rc.112). rc.125
//! pinned the *responder* onto the *initiator's* worker by reading the
//! initiator's advertised relayed address — but that read is racy: on
//! (re)start the initiator's current relay hasn't propagated yet, so the
//! responder pinned to a **stale** worker and never re-pinned, leaving the
//! pair split and the WireGuard handshake timing out forever (field bring-up
//! 2026-06-10: a restart merely *swapped* which side read stale).
//!
//! rc.127 removes the dependence on the peer's endpoint entirely: **both ends
//! pick the same coturn worker deterministically from the shared `pair_key`**
//! — a stable hash over the *resolved* coturn worker IPs. Same `pair_key`
//! (the server sends an identical `sorted(a,b)` to both) + same DNS record →
//! same sorted IP list → same index → same worker, with zero dependence on
//! propagation timing. No race, no latch; the hairpin is guaranteed.
//!
//! Per-peer flow (symmetric on both sides):
//! 1. peer appears → [`request`](RelayCoordinator::request) sends
//!    `rc:overlay.relay_request`.
//! 2. `rc:overlay.relay_grant` (coturn creds + `pair_key`) →
//!    [`grant_accept`](RelayCoordinator::grant_accept) stashes the creds and
//!    hands the runtime an alloc job; the runtime SPAWNS
//!    [`allocate_for_pair`] (DNS + TURN allocate — seconds on a hostile corp
//!    path, so never inline on the steady loop — rc.218) and commits the
//!    result back on-loop via
//!    [`commit_alloc`](RelayCoordinator::commit_alloc): advertise our relayed
//!    address, move to `allocated`, try to build.
//! 3. the peer's relayed address arrives in a netmap delta →
//!    [`maybe_complete`](RelayCoordinator::maybe_complete): build the
//!    `Carrier::relay` dialing it.
