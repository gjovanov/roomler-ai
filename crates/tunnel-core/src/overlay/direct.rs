//! Direct (LAN) carrier discovery for the overlay (rc.131).
//!
//! The overlay was relay-only: every peer connection rode a coturn TURN
//! allocation, even two machines on the same Wi-Fi LAN. That made it fragile
//! (it dies whenever a node can't reach coturn — UDP-blocked / TLS-inspected
//! corporate nets, carrier-CGNAT cellular) and added a relay hop's latency to
//! same-LAN peers. This module adds the **direct LAN path** (Tailscale's
//! direct-first model): a node advertises its LAN endpoint, and two peers on
//! the **same /24** build a direct UDP [`Carrier`](super::wg::Carrier) and skip
//! the relay entirely.
//!
//! Scope: **same-subnet only** (reliable L2 reachability — no NAT hole-punch,
//! no handshake-timeout fallback). Peers NOT on a shared subnet still use the
//! relay exactly as before. rc.131 advertised one interface (a connect-trick);
//! **rc.132 enumerates ALL interfaces** (a multi-homed host advertises every
//! LAN IP — field host WINHOST-A routes the internet via corporate Ethernet but
//! its peer is on the Wi-Fi). srflx hole-punch + an AP-isolation relay-fallback
//! are later follow-ups. See `docs/overlay-wfp.md` siblings.
