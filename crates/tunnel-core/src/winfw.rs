//! Windows Defender Firewall rules for THIS binary — the ONE definition of
//! the inbound-UDP allow rule, and the cleanup of the Block rules a Windows
//! Security prompt writes when it beats us to the first bind (#1698).
//!
//! Two consumers, one rule:
//!
//! * `overlay::tun::SystemTun::up` — every TUN bring-up, on a detached
//!   thread: the self-heal that keeps the recorded program path current
//!   across upgrades (P9, field-hit 2026-07-28: a fresh install had no rule,
//!   so unsolicited WG dials — LAN direct, srflx punch — died at the Public
//!   profile's default-deny).
//! * `roomlerd`'s SCM service host (`win_service`), LocalSystem, which
//!   installs the same rule BEFORE it spawns the worker the first time.
//!
//! Why the host must do it (#1698, measured on a 0.4.104 attended guest): on
//! an ATTENDED perMachine install the worker runs in the signed-in user's
//! session, and a session process that binds off-loopback UDP with no rule
//! for its path gets the interactive "Allow access?" prompt. The prompt
//! writes per-profile **Block** rules for the exe the moment it appears, and
//! in Defender an explicit Block beats an Allow — so the overlay's own rule,
//! added a few hundred ms later by the detached hygiene thread, lost on every
//! Public-profile network until someone clicked Allow. P9's premise ("a
//! Windows *service* never gets the prompt") holds for a SYSTEM worker only.
//!
//! The pure parts — the rule's shape and argument lists, the store parser,
//! the cleanup predicate, the PowerShell literal — compile on every platform
//! so the Linux CI lane runs their tests; only the effectful functions
//! (`netsh`, the registry read, `powershell`) are `#[cfg(windows)]`.
