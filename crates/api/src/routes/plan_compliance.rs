//! FR-32 P1c — "who would break if I turned enforcement on?"
//!
//! P2 of the pricing arc has to grandfather the tenants already over a limit
//! before flipping any of them to [`PlanEnforcement::Enforce`]. That question
//! is a **snapshot**, not an event stream, and the difference matters:
//!
//! - A denial log only ever sees tenants who happen to call the API during the
//!   observe window. A tenant sitting at 40 members on a 10-member plan that
//!   nobody adds to this month emits **nothing**, and would be flipped straight
//!   into a wall.
//! - A snapshot is complete, needs no accumulation window, and answers on the
//!   day the code deploys instead of weeks later.
//!
//! So the observe phase is served by this report rather than by a
//! `quota_denials` collection. The `tracing::warn!` line in `services::quota`
//! still records *frequency* — how often people actually collide with a limit —
//! which is a P3 pricing input, and a different question from this one.
//!
//! ⚠ Limits are read through [`quota::Limit::describe`], the same function the
//! gates use. A report that recomputed them independently could say a tenant is
//! compliant while the gate refuses them, which is worse than having no report.
