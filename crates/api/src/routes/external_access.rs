//! FR-52 cross-org remote access — the ADMIN surface
//! (`docs/fr/FR-52-cross-org-remote-access.md`): the org kill-switch (gate 1),
//! per-device approval (gate 2), the connect code an outsider names a device
//! by (§5), and the decision log.
//!
//! **P1 ships no access path.** Nothing here lets anyone in: the session
//! handshake (gates 3–5) lands in P3/P4, and until it does the only thing a
//! connect code resolves to is a device that refuses. What P1 establishes is
//! the policy surface, and — from the first commit — the audit, because a
//! refusal nobody can query is a refusal nobody will notice.
//!
//! ## Permissions — and why there is no `EXTERNAL_ACCESS` bit
//!
//! There is none to take. The UI mirror checks masks with JavaScript's signed
//! 32-bit bitwise ops and `VIEW_SSH_AUDIT` (`1 << 30`) is the ceiling by design
//! (`role.rs`, #888). Approval therefore rides `MANAGE_AGENTS` **and**
//! `REMOTE_CONTROL`: you may open a device to an outsider only if you could
//! control it yourself, which is a coherence rule rather than a stand-in.
//!
//! ⚠️ **This is not the FR-19 shape, and it is weaker.** FR-19 pairs
//! `MANAGE_AGENTS` with `EXEC_DEVICE`, which `DEFAULT_ADMIN` deliberately does
//! NOT carry, so it is a real extra grant. `DEFAULT_ADMIN` **does** carry
//! `REMOTE_CONTROL`, so this pair is no hurdle at all for the seeded `admin`
//! role — it bites only on a custom role built with `MANAGE_AGENTS` and not
//! `REMOTE_CONTROL`. Saying otherwise would overstate the control, so: the
//! hurdle for cross-org access is deliberately NOT here. It is the org switch
//! above it (`MANAGE_TENANT`), the device's own opt-in, and the password the
//! device holds and this server never sees. Gate 2 is an org-side VETO, not
//! the security boundary.
//!
//! Borrowing `EXEC_DEVICE` for this would be defensible — an `EXEC_DEVICE`
//! holder can already `roomler exec` its way to setting the device password as
//! root — but it would exclude the natural approver, a fleet admin who holds
//! no root-command grant, in exchange for a hurdle the design does not lean
//! on. A dedicated bit waits on the BigInt migration; FR-52 open decision 5.
//!
//! Clearing an approval needs only `MANAGE_AGENTS`: revocation is not a grant,
//! and the person who can open a door must not be the only one who can shut it.
//!
//! The org switch is `MANAGE_TENANT`, like `exec-settings` and `peer-relay`:
//! whether this org can be reached from outside at all is an org-owner
//! decision, not a fleet-admin one. Reading the settings is `MANAGE_AGENTS`,
//! like every other device-fleet view.

///    applies here.
/// 3. A device whose agent does not advertise [`RpcCap::ExternalAccess`] cannot
///    be approved. That gate is here, at approval time, rather than only at
///    session time on purpose: such an agent shows the person at the machine
///    the ordinary "someone wants to control this" panel with no hint that the
///    someone is a stranger, so approving it would put a promise on screen that
///    the device does not keep — and consent given under it would not be
///    informed consent.

/// ⚠️ Rule 3 is checked against what the device said on its LAST hello, which
/// is all the server ever knows. An offline device that previously advertised
