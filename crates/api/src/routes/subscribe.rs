//! FR-39 — PUBLIC subscribe / confirm / unsubscribe.
//!
//! No auth extractor anywhere in this module. For `confirm` and `unsubscribe`
//! the unguessable token IS the capability, the same shape as
//! `routes::consent`. For `subscribe` there is no capability at all — it is an
//! open form — which is why two properties below are load-bearing rather than
//! polish:
//!
//! 1. **Every outcome answers 202.** New address, address already on the list,
//!    address that unsubscribed last year: indistinguishable. A response that
//!    told them apart would be a membership oracle, and the addresses on this
//!    list are overwhelmingly also `users.email` values — a field that is a
//!    unique index *and* the key OAuth account-linking resolves against.
//! 2. **Resends are on a cooldown** (`SubscriberDao`). An open form that mails
//!    whoever is named in the body is a mail bomb pointed at that person,
//!    posted from our own domain.
//!
//! A third follows from the first and is easy to undo by accident: the
//! confirmation mail is **sent from a detached task**, so the response time does
//! not depend on whether one was sent. Awaiting it inline would leak the same
//! membership fact through latency that the status code refuses to leak
//! directly.
