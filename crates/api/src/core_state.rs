//! FR-69 P1b — `Core` lives in `roomler-core` now (`roomler_core::Core`);
//! this module keeps the api-side glue under the path P1a introduced.
//!
//! The one thing that cannot move with it is the `FromRef` impl below: the
//! orphan rules let this crate write it because `AppState` is local, and
//! `roomler-core` must not know `AppState` exists. It is what makes
//! `State<Core>` work in a handler while the router's state is still
//! `AppState`.
