//! FR-84 D5a — the agent-JWT extractor for the HOST's routes.
//!
//! The fleet module's [`roomler_ai_mod_fleet::auth_agent::AuthAgent`] is the
//! one place an agent token turns into an authorization decision, and it is
//! an extractor so a handler cannot forget the check. Its bound is
//! `FleetState: FromRef<S>`, which the host's `AppState` cannot satisfy: the
//! fleet module is an `Option` there (`[modules] fleet = false` unmounts it,
//! never a boot refusal), and a `FromRef` that panics on `None` would turn a
//! deliberate unmount into a 500.
//!
//! So the host has its own extractor over the SAME decision — the shared
//! [`authenticate`] — and adds exactly one rule of its own: no fleet module
//! ⇒ 503, the answer every other fleet-dependent surface gives when the
//! module is switched off, so an agent dialling a pod without it learns it is
//! not a credential problem.
