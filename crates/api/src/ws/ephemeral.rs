//! FR-51 — ephemeral nodes: the reaper, and the one removal sequence it
//! shares with the admin DELETE.
//!
//! A device enrolled `ephemeral: true` has declared, at enrollment, that it is
//! temporary: once it has been silent past its TTL the deployment removes it —
//! device row, overlay lease, address, MagicDNS name — with no admin action.
//!
//! Three design constraints, each measured against the tree rather than
//! assumed (`docs/fr/FR-51-ephemeral-nodes.md` §3):
//!
//! * **Own query, never the presence sweep's scan set.** `run_presence_sweep`
//!   settles an absent row to `last_presence: "offline"`, after which the row
//!   matches neither branch of `find_presence_scan_set` and is never scanned
//!   again — a reaper hung off that loop would see each row exactly once, so
//!   any deadline longer than one sweep interval would silently never fire
//!   (and a test written with a short deadline would pass).
//! * **One removal sequence.** [`remove_agent_device`] is `delete_agent`
//!   minus the HTTP layer and minus the permission check; the reaper calls
//!   the same function the route does. `release_overlay_node`'s four-step
//!   order (peers-while-live → CAS-tombstone → pool → fan `removes`) is
//!   load-bearing, and a second, subtly different teardown path is the main
//!   way this feature could do harm.
//! * **Hard delete.** The `(tenant_id, machine_id)` unique index is not
//!   partial on `deleted_at`, so a tombstoned ephemeral row would reserve its
//!   random, never-reused machine_id forever. The DAO's
//!   `hard_delete_ephemeral` filters on `ephemeral: true`, so a permanent row
//!   structurally cannot take this path.
//!
//! Kill switch: `rc.ephemeral_reaper_enabled`, default **false** — zero
//! queries, zero deletes. Even enabled, the predicate (`ephemeral: true`)
//! cannot match any pre-FR-51 row: they all deserialise permanent.
