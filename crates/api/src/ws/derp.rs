//! `/derp` — a pubkey-addressed WebSocket relay for the both-UDP-blocked
//! overlay carrier tier (NAT-traversal Phase D, DERP).
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! The overlay carrier cascade (LAN-direct → public-direct → srflx-punch →
//! single-relay) covers every peer pair EXCEPT one: two nodes that are BOTH on
//! all-UDP-blocked networks (a strict corp firewall that permits only
//! TCP/TLS-443). Single-relay provably can't serve them — exactly one side must
//! be the raw-UDP dialer, and neither has UDP. DERP breaks the deadlock because
//! **both peers dial OUT** over TCP/TLS-443 to this rendezvous relay: no UDP, no
//! inbound-reachable allocation, no TURN permission model. It's Tailscale's
//! DERP, scoped to a single overlay network.
//!
//! # What the relay does
//!
//! It is a dumb, opaque, pubkey-keyed forwarder. A node opens ONE `/derp` WSS,
//! sends its 32-byte WireGuard public key as the first (registration) frame,
//! then exchanges binary data frames of the form `[dst_pubkey(32) || payload]`.
//! The relay rewrites the prefix to the SENDER's pubkey and delivers
//! `[src_pubkey(32) || payload]` to the destination — but ONLY to a peer
//! registered in the **same overlay network** (hard tenant/network isolation,
//! the same scope the netmap fan-out enforces). The payload is opaque WG
//! ciphertext; the relay never inspects or decrypts it — WireGuard is
//! end-to-end between the two nodes.
//!
//! # Security
//!
//! - **Auth**: the agent JWT, same audience as `/ws?role=agent`
//!   (`verify_agent_token`). The DB is authoritative for the agent's tenant, so
//!   a forged tenant claim can't widen scope.
//! - **Registration authz**: a node may only register a pubkey that matches its
//!   OWN `overlay_nodes.wg_public_key` — it can't claim a peer's key to
//!   intercept that peer's frames.
//! - **Network scoping**: a frame is delivered only to a pubkey registered in
//!   the sender's own network. The `(network_id, pubkey)` registry key makes a
//!   cross-network delivery structurally impossible.
//!
//! Placement (v1): on the `roomler2` API pods (hostNetwork, :443), behind the
//! dedicated `/derp` nginx `location`. The registry is in-memory on a
//! single-replica Recreate deployment, so a web deploy severs all DERP links
//! (they rebuild via the carrier `dead` latch) and it can't scale past one
//! replica — fine for the handful of corp pairs this tier serves.
