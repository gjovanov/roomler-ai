//! Per-(caller, device) request limiter for the exec / SSH control planes.
//!
//! Both subsystems DOCUMENT a per-minute ceiling (`exec::RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE`,
//! `ssh::RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE`) and both define a `RateLimited` deny reason,
//! but nothing ever enforced them: the constants had no readers and the deny
//! reason was constructed only in tests. That left two real gaps —
//!
//! * the global `tower_governor` is per-IP and HTTP-only, so it never saw the
//!   device-originated `rc:rpc.request` / `rc:ssh.request` WebSocket legs; and
//! * an SSH caller could burst grants faster than the target's 16-slot pending
//!   table, evicting a legitimate caller's un-redeemed grant (the table drops
//!   the OLDEST) — a targeted denial of someone else's access.
//!
//! Enforcement lives in the shared `authorize` of each subsystem, which is the
//! one place BOTH the HTTP route and the WS leg funnel through, so neither
//! transport can acquire an unlimited path by accident.
//!
//! Sliding window rather than a token bucket: the documented unit is literally
//! "N per minute", and a window keeps that exact meaning with no refill-rate
//! translation for an operator to get wrong.
