//! #1731 — the stall watchdog.
//!
//! A `roomler2` pod went completely silent twice in 9 h: not one log line,
//! `/health` unanswered, until the liveness probe killed it ~105 s later. A
//! kill takes the only evidence with it, and a runtime that makes no progress
//! cannot log why. So the evidence has to be taken by something that does not
//! need the runtime, and kept somewhere that outlives the container.
//!
//! - A **heartbeat** task on the runtime stamps an atomic every 500 ms.
//! - A plain OS **thread** looks every second. When the stamp is older than
//!   the threshold, it writes a dump, and while the stall lasts it adds a fresh
//!   sample every 20 s, so the dump shows whether the stuck threads move at all.
//! - A sample is written in stages, each one on disk before the next is
//!   attempted: the header (runtime metrics, the stdout/stderr pipe fill, memory,
//!   pressure and throttling), then every thread's `/proc` state (its syscall
//!   with arguments, its kernel wait channel), then stacks one thread at a time.
//!   Each stack is walked by the thread itself in a signal handler, because
//!   only it can walk its own stack without stopping the world. A thread that
//!   cannot answer (uninterruptible sleep, stopped) is not asked, and the whole
//!   sample has a stack budget, so a dump is never lost to a slow walk.
//! - The dump goes to a FILE, never to stdout or through `tracing`. The leading
//!   suspect is a blocked stdout: the fmt layer writes synchronously under the
//!   process-wide stdout lock. Whatever blocked the runtime may well block that
//!   too. The next process reports any unreported dump at boot
//!   ([`report_previous_dumps`]), which puts it in plain `kubectl logs`.
//!
//! Linux only, which is production. Elsewhere [`start`] runs the heartbeat and
//! the watchdog, but a dump says stacks are not captured there.
