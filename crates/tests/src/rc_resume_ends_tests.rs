//! FR-138 — how a resumable session ENDS at the edges the reviews of P1b
//! found, through real servers, real sockets and one MongoDB shared by the
//! pods (`TestApp::spawn_pair`):
//!
//! * a session its viewer was never told it may hold ends at its device's
//!   socket loss, though the device was told a window since (review 2, N3);
//! * a claim refused for a reason of no one's choosing leaves no open row
//!   behind: the gate could not be run, or the window closed between the
//!   claim's read and its commit (N4);
//! * a claim that lost its commit to an older connection's claim of the same
//!   device is tried once more, and the newest connection wins (M4); the
//!   older connection's claim leaves the winner's session and FR-115 slot
//!   alone (L1);
//! * the device's own end replaces an end inferred before this connection,
//!   by an earlier connection's registration or by the sweep, but never the
//!   one-time close's (N5);
//! * a hold nobody rejoins ends marked `hold_expired` (N17), and a rejoin that
//!   comes just after it is told a reason the page redials on (N9);
//! * an end someone asks for never overwrites an inferred one (N11), while at
//!   window 0 a session's end reads on its row as it always has.
//!
//! Two claims racing cannot be ordered through sockets, so those tests hand
//! the claim a row read before the other claim committed
//! (`resume::claim_as_read`), on a connection registered straight in the hub.
