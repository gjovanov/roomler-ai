//! FR-138 (D5 = A, the operator, 2026-11-11) — what a redial's `replaces`
//! writes to the row of a session that no hub on the redial's pod holds,
//! through real servers and real sockets:
//!
//! * **detached**: the device's socket went, and no pod holds the session. A
//!   viewer the server told so redials only once its peer is gone (the
//!   device's own deadline closed it, or the peer failed during the gap), and
//!   names the session in `replaces`. So the session ended on the device's
//!   side: its row ends `agent_disconnect`, marked inferred
//!   (`end_source: redial`) and dated by the row's own last clock. The
//!   device's claim then hears that reason, and the slot is the person's
//!   again;
//! * **the device's own end replaces it**: a device that ended the session
//!   during the gap (its `rc:ended` lost on the way to the viewer) says so
//!   after its hello, and its reason replaces the inference;
//! * **attached**: the session is held on the device's pod for a viewer whose
//!   own socket dropped. Its redial, on the other pod, ends it
//!   `controller_hangup` as before, and the pod that holds it is told.
//!
//! The controller's own `rc:terminate` of a detached session stays
//! `controller_hangup`
//! (`rc_resume_rejoin_tests::a_controllers_end_during_the_gap_is_enforced_at_the_claim`).
