//! FR-138 — the server's resume at the edges the P1b reviews deferred to
//! "PR D", through real servers, real sockets and one MongoDB shared by the
//! pods (`TestApp::spawn_pair`):
//!
//! * a detached session keeps its FR-115 slot against a request on its own
//!   pod, whose stale-lease check reads the row first (M5), and at window 0
//!   that check is what it always was;
//! * a claim that loses its commit never renews or retags the winner's lease
//!   (`refuse_claim`'s race);
//! * a claim whose connection was displaced after its commit writes the
//!   detach back, so the row is not left open with no pod and no deadline
//!   (L2);
//! * a detached session's lease lives until `resume_by` plus 10 s, and no
//!   longer (L5);
//! * an external session is marked on its row while its device holds a
//!   window, and a claim of a marked row is refused (L6, D3);
//! * an admin's end during the gap that cannot be written answers 503, not
//!   200 (N10);
//! * the rejoin of a detached session runs the gate at most once per 5 s for
//!   its viewer (N14).
//!
//! And the edges PR D's own review found:
//!
//! * a lease this pod holds for a session no hub holds is kept only while
//!   the row can still be resumed: past `resume_by` plus the 10 s grace, or
//!   live with no `resume_by` on a device outside the resume scope, it is
//!   dropped as before FR-138 (MEDIUM 1, LOW 4);
//! * the lease's expiry only grows: a renewal, a claim, a restore and a keep
//!   never shorten a kept lease, and a keep never revives a lapsed one
//!   (LOW 5, LOW 7, and the renewal's test gap);
//! * a resumed session whose slot another session took during the gap ends,
//!   fenced at the number its claim committed (a test gap);
//! * a viewer removed from the org during the gap is refused within about
//!   5 s on a detached row, and the rate's entry goes once the session is
//!   bound (a test gap, LOW 8).
