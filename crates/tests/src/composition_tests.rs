//! FR-69 — the composition baseline.
//!
//! Every module PR in the decoupling program is "pure moves plus signature
//! changes". This test is what makes that a checked claim: it builds the real
//! server, snapshots what the full profile is composed of, and asserts the
//! snapshot is byte-identical to the committed baseline in
//! `crates/tests/fixtures/composition.baseline.json`.
//!
//! The snapshot holds three things, each chosen because a move can break it
//! while every other test stays green:
//!
//! * **routes** — every served path with its allowed methods, read from the
//!   built router (a dropped or re-pathed route in a move shows up here even if
//!   no integration test exercises it);
//! * **indexes** — the index plan for both `multi_block` values, in
//!   application order (a module that takes its collections with it must take
//!   its index specs unchanged);
//! * **wire** — every `rename = "…"` name in the RC signalling source, in
//!   order (the enum is deliberately NOT moved by FR-69; this keeps "the wire
//!   did not change" a statement with a check behind it).
//!
//! Deliberately NOT here: settings keys (the config crate is untouched by the
//! program) and the WebSocket namespace map (it exists from P5 and is baselined
//! when it does).
//!
//! **To update the baseline** — only when a change is intended, and say why in
//! the commit message so the reviewer can diff the JSON against the claim:
//!
//! ```text
//! COMPOSITION_UPDATE=1 cargo test -p roomler-ai-tests composition_matches_baseline
//! ```
//!
//! **Without a local server build** (a Windows dev box has no OpenSSL or
//! mediasoup toolchain; the server lane on this project is Linux): push the
//! change with the baseline file absent, and the integration lane prints the
//! snapshot between `BEGIN/END COMPOSITION BASELINE` markers in the failing
//! test's output. Save those lines as the baseline file, push again, and the
//! lane goes green. The baseline is then what CI itself composed — the
//! environment the gate runs in.
//!
//! The precondition asserts (a route count, an index-set count, a wire-name
//! count) are load-bearing in the `harness_tests` sense: without them an empty
//! snapshot would match an empty baseline and the test would pass proving
//! nothing — which is exactly how a parser that silently stopped matching
//! axum's Debug format would present.
