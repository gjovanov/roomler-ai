//! FR-83 — an SSH grant is confirmed before the caller is told to dial.
//!
//! Driven through a RAW agent socket rather than the `roomlerd` library, for
//! two reasons. The test crate builds the agent without `ssh-server`, so the
//! real one could not take a grant at all; and what these lock is the
//! SERVER's ordering, which only a peer that decides exactly when — and
//! whether — it answers can observe.
//!
//! The assertions read the response JSON only, never a type FR-83 added, so
//! this file also compiles against the server as it was before FR-83. That is
//! how the ordering and gate-4 tests were shown to FAIL there: the caller was
//! answered with an address at once, before — and regardless of — anything
//! the device said.
