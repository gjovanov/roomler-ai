//! FR-90 P2b — what a checkpoint takes of a session's config directory, and how
//! a member puts it back together.
//!
//! At each turn's end the primary checkpoints its session: the five allowlisted
//! paths of Claude Code's config directory ([`allowlist`]), and later in P2b the
//! workspace. The daemon never reads a path the session's account controls, so
//! [`take`] runs AS THE ACCOUNT, in `roomlerd hive-checkpoint` (P2b-3). What it
//! produces is a [`Checkpoint`], recorded in the chain as a `checkpoint` event
//! (so two members at the same `(seq, hash)` hold the same files), and the
//! blobs it names, each BLAKE3-named as the replica store keeps them.
//!
//! Two shapes of file, as P2b's probes found Claude Code writes them (spec §8):
//!
//! | File | How Claude Code writes it | How a checkpoint takes it |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | the history `<id>.jsonl`, a sub-agent's `agent-<id>.jsonl` | only appended to (`O_APPEND`) | the bytes past the last checkpoint, up to the last whole line |
//! | everything else in the allowlist | replaced (a rename), or written once | whole, by hash, and only when it changed |
//!
//! The chain is the state: a file's `len` and `hash` in the last checkpoint are
//! where the next one starts ([`Previous`]), so nothing else is kept between
//! turns. A file that shrank, or changed before its last offset, is taken again
//! from its first byte, and the checkpoint says so.
//!
//! ⚠️ **An allowlist, never the directory.** The config directory's root holds a
//! `peerToken` beside the harness's messaging socket and a `machineID` (§3b's
//! probes). Nothing outside the five paths is ever opened.
//!
//! ⚠️ **A link is never followed.** The allowlist holds Claude Code's own files;
//! a link there to the account's `~/.ssh` would copy a key to every member. A
//! link, or a name that is not UTF-8, is listed in [`Checkpoint::skipped`] and
//! taken nowhere.
