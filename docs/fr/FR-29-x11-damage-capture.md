# FR-29 — X11 capture reads the whole screen even when nothing changed

**Issue:** [#864](https://github.com/gjovanov/roomler-ai/issues/864) · **Status:** CLOSED — P1 shipped (0.4.17), P2 merged, P3 ruled out by measurement · **Owner:** agent / capture

## Goal

Break the ~20 ms-per-frame X11 capture floor that pins every Linux
remote-desktop host at ~25–27 fps at 1080p, and make an *idle* desktop
approximately free to serve instead of costing half a CPU core.

## Field evidence (2026-08-28/29, `scw-m2-asahi`, Fedora Asahi 42, M2 Pro)

`avg_capture_ms` measured on the same host across three progressively more
"real" display stacks, H.264-SW, XFCE, 1920×1080:

| display stack | idle capture | scroll capture | idle CPU | fps |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Xvfb (virtual framebuffer) | 19.3 ms | 21.9 ms | 49.5 % of a core | 26.4 |
| real KMS Xorg, software render | 21.2 ms | 20.9 ms | 49.8 % | 25.2 |
| real KMS Xorg, **GPU-accelerated** | 22.2 ms | 22.1 ms | 45.8 % | 25.2 |

Three conclusions the matrix forces:

1. **Capture cost is indifferent to how the framebuffer was drawn.** Adding a
   real display controller changed nothing; adding full GPU acceleration
   (`glamor` on `Apple M2 Pro (G14S B1)`, glxgears 3221 fps) changed nothing.
2. **Capture, not encode, is the bottleneck.** `avg_encode_ms` was 14–18 ms
   against a 33 ms budget at 30 fps; capture ate the larger half.
3. **Idle costs the same as active.** A completely static desktop paid the
   full ~20 ms readback 25 times a second — ~50 % of a core to send 0.2 Mbps.

This is not Asahi-specific and not a GPU problem. It is a property of the X11
capture path and therefore applies to **every Linux desktop host in the fleet**.

## Root cause

`scrap` on Linux is XShm. `Capturer::frame()` performs a full-screen
`GetImage` on every call and has no "nothing changed" signal — unlike Windows
DXGI Desktop Duplication, which returns `WouldBlock` when the desktop is
unchanged. Two consequences in
[`capture/scrap_backend.rs`](../../agents/roomlerd/src/capture/scrap_backend.rs):

- `scrap_backend.rs:375` — the `WouldBlock` arm is the "no new frame" path.
  **On Linux it is unreachable**: XShm always yields a full buffer.
- `scrap_backend.rs:366` — every delivered frame is stamped
  `damage: Damage::Unknown`, so the encoder must treat all pixels as dirty and
  `peer.rs:2376`'s `set_roi_hints` receives an empty rect list.

The pump already has the fast path this needs. `peer.rs:2052` logs
`"capture produced no frame (idle screen)"` on a `None` from `next_frame` and
counts `frames_empty`. **That path exists, is named, and is simply
unreachable on Linux.** P1 is about making it reachable, not about inventing it.

`Damage` (`capture/mod.rs:76`) likewise already distinguishes the two empty
states — `Unknown` ("no information, assume all dirty") vs `Tracked(vec![])`
("provably nothing changed"). Only the producer is missing.

## Design

A Linux-only damage tracker in the capture worker, on its own X11 connection
(`x11rb` 0.13.2, already in `Cargo.lock` transitively via enigo/arboard; needs
its `damage` feature enabled). The worker registers `XDamage` on the root
window and drains events before each grab.

| Phase | What | Kill switch |
|---|---|---|
| **P1** | Damage-gated grab: no damage since the last delivered frame ⇒ return `Ok(None)` and skip the XShm readback entirely, reusing the existing idle-screen path. | `ROOMLERD_X11_DAMAGE=0` ⇒ today's behaviour byte-for-byte |
| **P2 — SHIPPED (groundwork)** | Emit `Damage::Tracked(rects)` instead of `Damage::Unknown`. ⚠️ Delivers **no user-visible change today**: both would-be consumers are inert (see below). Its value is as P3’s input and as parity with the Windows WGC backend. | same flag; `Unknown` is the fallback, never a wrong rect list |
| **P3 — NOT VIABLE on this driver (measured)** | Partial readback — `GetImage` only the damaged bounding box into a persistent backbuffer, instead of the full screen. This is where the residual ~20 ms on *active* frames goes. | same flag; falls back to full-frame grab |

### The safety valve is load-bearing

A missed or coalesced damage event under P1 means a **frozen stream**, which is
far worse than a slow one. So P1 forces an unconditional full capture at least
every `ROOMLERD_X11_DAMAGE_MAX_SKIP_MS` (default **1000 ms**). Worst case
for a damage bug is therefore a 1 s stale tile, self-healing, not a dead
session. This bound is the reason P1 is safe to default on.

### `frames_unchanged` must NOT be folded into `frames_empty`

`frames_empty` today means *the pump was starved* — the documented diagnostic
is `frames_empty ≫ frames_encoded ⇒ frame-production-bound`. "Nothing changed"
is the opposite: a healthy, cheap idle. Folding them would silently destroy a
working diagnostic, so P1 adds a distinct counter and heartbeat field.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Idle 1080p XFCE: roomlerd CPU **45.8 % → 3.4 %** of a core. (The
      `avg_capture_ms < 2 ms` half is **superseded, not met**: idle ticks no
      longer capture at all, so there is no per-frame capture time to average.
      The criterion assumed a cheaper readback; P1 removes the readback.)
- [ ] **NOT met — and not addressable by P1.** Under sustained motion fps went
      26.4 → 27.6 and capture 22.1 → 20.6 ms, i.e. unchanged within noise.
      Every frame is genuinely damaged under continuous motion, so every frame
      is still read in full. This is what **P3** (partial readback) exists for;
      recording it as an honest partial rather than reframing the target.
- [x] Safety valve measured: on a genuinely static screen, captures ran at
      **1.0 /s** at `MAX_SKIP_MS=1000`. ⚠️ Re-measuring at 4000 ms still gave
      ~1.07 /s because a real XFCE desktop is **never** static — the panel
      clock repaints every second. `frames_unchanged` climbing ~28 /s beside
      `frames_captured` ~0.94 /s is the proof both halves work.
- [x] `frames_unchanged` reported separately — field-observed
      `frames_empty=2250 frames_unchanged=2250`, i.e. every empty was a
      *proven* no-change rather than a starved pump.
- [x] Windows and macOS untouched — the module and its call site are
      `#[cfg(all(target_os = "linux", feature = "scrap-capture"))]`.
- [x] `ROOMLERD_X11_DAMAGE=0` restores prior behaviour: idle went back to
      **50.6 %** CPU / 26.4 fps / 19.1 ms capture.
- [x] Field-verified on `scw-m2-asahi` as a same-session A/B — damage OFF
      50.6 %, damage ON 3.4 %, on the same host minutes apart.

## Open decisions

- ~~**Is root-window damage sufficient under a compositing WM?**~~ **SETTLED
  for XFCE/xfwm4, both directions** (2026-08-29). With `use_compositing=true`:
  motion still captured at **27.3 fps** (damage is not hidden by the
  redirection) *and* idle still cost **3.0 %** of a core (a compositor does not
  flood damage and defeat the skip). Both failure modes were plausible; neither
  occurs. ⚠️ **Plasma/KWin and GNOME/Mutter remain untested** — both are
  installed on the field host, so this is cheap to close and should be done
  before P1 defaults on for hosts running those sessions.
- Whether P3's partial readback is worth its complexity, or whether P1 alone
  (idle free, active unchanged) already buys the operator experience we want.

## Out of scope

- **Wayland / PipeWire capture.** Required for accelerated Wayland desktops
  (and the only way to capture an Asahi GPU session), but it is a new backend,
  not a change to this one. Separate FR.
- **Windows DXGI** — already has the equivalent via `WouldBlock`.
- **Hardware video encode** — measured impossible on Apple Silicon under Linux:
  no `/dev/video*`, and `vulkaninfo` reports 0 `VK_KHR_video_encode*`
  extensions. Not a lever on this hardware.

## Field-verification log

| date | build | result |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-08-29 | 0.4.15 (pre-change baseline) | idle capture 22.2 ms, CPU 45.8 %, 25.2 fps — the numbers P1 must move |
| 2026-08-29 | P1, source build on the host | **idle CPU 3.4 % (13×)**; motion unchanged (45.0 %, 20.6 ms, 27.6 fps); kill switch back to 50.6 % |
| 2026-08-29 | P1, xfwm4 **compositing ON** | motion 27.3 fps / 44.2 % / 20.4 ms; **idle 3.0 %** — a compositor neither hides damage nor floods it |

### What the field test caught that CI never would

1. **The media heartbeat goes silent exactly when P1 works.** It fires per 30
   *encoded* frames, so once captures are skipped there is nothing to key on —
   the idle host emitted **one heartbeat in two minutes** and `frames_unchanged`
   (added to make idle observable) was itself unobservable. Fixed by moving the
   periodic idle signal onto the already-rate-limited "idle screen" log.
2. **A headless remote-desktop host locks itself.** `xfce4-screensaver` blanked
   and then LOCKED the session mid-test; the viewer showed pure black at 1 fps.
   That black frame was faithful — capture was correct and the safety valve was
   ticking exactly as designed — but it cost a wasted measurement round, and on
   a real deployment an operator would connect to an unusable lock screen with
   no local keyboard. Screensaver, lock and DPMS are now disabled on the host.
   ⚠️ Worth considering whether the installer should do this for VD/headless
   roles; a host that autologins has little reason to lock.
3. **"Idle" desktops are not idle.** The panel clock repaints every second, so
   damage genuinely fires ~1 /s. Any future test of the safety valve must use a
   truly static screen or it will measure the clock instead.
4. ⚠️ **`roomler-encode-probe` reports nonsense across a session boundary** —
   counters reset, so `last - first` goes negative and printed `-10.8/s`. It
   also divides by a near-zero window when few frames encode, which is where a
   misleading `avg_capture_ms=36` came from. Read its output as suspect unless
   the heartbeat count is healthy and the deltas are positive.

## P2 result (2026-08-29) — it works, and it currently feeds nothing

**Verified**: `damage_tracked_frames` equals `frames_encoded` under load (240/240),
so every delivered frame now carries real rectangles rather than `Damage::Unknown`.
**No regression to P1**: idle stayed at **3.3 %** of a core with
`frames_empty=2850 frames_unchanged=2850` — the skip is fully intact — and motion
was unchanged (41.5–45 % across runs, within noise of the P1 numbers).

⚠️⚠️ **Both production consumers of `Damage` are inert**, which was not obvious
until it was checked:

- `encode/mod.rs:758` — `set_roi_hints` is a **default no-op that discards its
  arguments**, and no encoder overrides it.
- `rate_profile::note_real_frame_area` and `Damage::area_permille` have **no
  production callers** — every call site is `#[cfg(test)]`.

So P2 ships correct data that nothing reads. That is stated rather than implied:
its justification is (a) it is exactly the input P3's partial readback needs, and
(b) it brings the Linux backend to the contract the Windows WGC backend has had
since P8a. If P3 is not pursued, P2 is cost without benefit — though the measured
cost is below noise.

⚠️ **`avg_damage_permille` reads 1000 ‰ under load and that is an upper bound, not
a measurement.** `Damage::area_permille` SUMS rect areas and caps at the frame, and
its own doc says overlap over-counts; `RAW_RECTANGLES` yields many overlapping
rects, so it saturates. For judging whether P3 can pay off, the **union** area is
the number that matters, and it is not what this field reports.

⚠️ **The media heartbeat cannot sample an idle screen — by construction.** It fires
per 30 *encoded* frames, so any heartbeat you can read necessarily describes a busy
second. Two "idle" damage samples that looked alarming were simply busy windows.
Diagnose idle from the `idle screen` log line, never from the heartbeat.

## P3 VERDICT — measured, and it does not pay off (2026-08-29)

P3's premise was that the damaged region is much smaller than the frame, so a
partial readback would read far fewer bytes. **Measured on `scw-m2-asahi`
(Xorg `modesetting` + glamor), that premise is false:**

| workload | `avg_damage_rects` | union ‰ | bbox ‰ |
|---|---|---|---|
| window drag | **1** | 1000 | 1000 |
| scrolling terminal | 17–19 | 1000 | 1000 |

A *window drag* produces **one rectangle covering the whole screen**. The X
server does not localise root-window damage on this driver at all — it reports
"everything changed". Verified with xfwm4 compositing both **on and off**, so it
is the server/driver, not the compositor.

**Consequence: P3 is not worth building on this path.** A partial readback keyed
on this damage would read the entire frame anyway; the ~20 ms capture cost that
caps the host near 27 fps is untouchable from here. Lifting the motion ceiling
needs a different source of "what changed" — not a smarter reader of this one.

This also explains P1 in hindsight, and vindicates its design: `NON_EMPTY` gave
a *boolean* ("something changed"), which is exactly and only what the idle skip
needs, and that boolean is reliable even though the rectangles are worthless.

⚠️ Scope of the result: **one server + driver**. Other fleet hosts may report
fine-grained damage, which is why the measurement ships rather than just the
conclusion — `avg_damage_rects` / `avg_damage_union_permille` make this a
per-host question anyone can answer from a heartbeat, instead of a guess.

⚠️ Do not read `union == bbox == 1000` alone as "many small rects tiling the
screen". Union and bbox are identical in both worlds; only the **count**
separates a single full-screen rect (P3 dead) from hundreds of small ones
(P3 plausible). That ambiguity is why the count is reported.
