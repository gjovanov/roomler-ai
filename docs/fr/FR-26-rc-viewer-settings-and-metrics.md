# FR-26 — Remote-desktop viewer: display name, quality-metric toggles, FSR default, settings reorg

**Issue:** [#840](https://github.com/gjovanov/roomler-ai/issues/840)
**Status:** shipped in #845 — **field-verified 2026-08-29, all criteria met**

> **Renumbered from FR-24.** #838 (licensing split) claimed FR-24 in the same
> hours from a parallel session, and its ledger row lived on an unmerged branch
> while this one merged first — so the table could not arbitrate. Repaired by
> the standing rule: the **lower issue id keeps the number**, so #838 keeps
> FR-24 and this one moved to the next free N. FR-25 is #839, hence FR-26.
> Numbers already settled stay settled.

## Goal

Four operator items against the viewer, all about *what the operator sees while
a session runs*: the wrong name in the title, six metric pills with no way to
choose between them, a sharpening default tuned for video rather than text, and
a settings dialog that had grown into one long scroll.

## Changes

### 1. The display name wins in the title

`RemoteControl.vue` rendered `agent?.name` — the raw machine name — while
/devices, the sidebar and the dashboard mesh graph have all preferred the
admin-set `display_name` since FR-11. The viewer was the last surface that
disagreed, which is jarring precisely when you are looking at the machine.

Title is now `display_name || name`, and when they differ the machine name
moves into the existing subtitle — title `CORPLAP-1`, subtitle
`<machine-name> · windows · 0.4.11` — so the mapping stays visible rather than
hidden.

⚠️ `<machine-name>` is a placeholder on purpose: on the device this was checked
against, that field is a **corporate asset tag**, and it does not belong in a
public repo. The point of the criterion is only that the two strings DIFFER and
that both remain on screen.

### 2. Quality metrics are per-pill checkboxes

The toolbar readout grew one pill at a time until it was six wide:

| pill | example |
|---|---|
| codec / transport / decoder | `AV1 4:2:0 HW (av1_qsv) · direct · dec HW · FSR` |
| bitrate | `1.8 Mbps` |
| frame rate | `13 fps` |
| resolution | `2880×1800` |
| frame age (end to end) | `~4 ms` |
| pipeline diagnostics | `paint 0.3/0.4 · fwd 0.1/0.1 · dec …` |

Each now has a checkbox in **Viewer settings → Metrics**, stored as one object
under `roomler-rc-metrics`. **All default ON except `paint`** — the per-hop
numbers answer a question ("is this fps ceiling paint-, decode- or
main-thread-bound?") that only matters while you are chasing it.

Two details worth keeping:

- the fallback is **per key**, so an object written by an older build (fewer
  pills) keeps working and a newly added pill appears rather than silently
  reading `false`;
- `paint` **inherits the legacy `roomler-rc-diag-hud=1` flag** on first read, so
  anyone who set that undiscoverable knob by hand keeps their HUD; once the
  checkbox is used the stored object wins.

### 3. FSR sharpening defaults to ON

`normalizeSharpenMode` defaulted to `'auto'` — sharpen only when the stream is
smaller than the window. The viewer is used for **text** far more than for
video, and always-on RCAS is what makes remote text crisp at 1:1 too. Default is
now `'on'`; `auto` and `off` remain selectable, and an explicit stored choice is
untouched.

⚠️ Two test sites asserted the old default (`normalizeSharpenMode` and
`storedSharpenMode`) — both updated rather than deleted, so the round-trip of
the other two modes is still locked.

### 4. Settings dialog: four tabs

`Video · Display · Metrics · Session`, replacing one scrolling card with three
flat sections and ~8 stacked block buttons — on a phone (where the dialog is
fullscreen) the Session tools were below two screenfuls. Nothing moved between
sections except the new Metrics pane; FSR stays in **Display**, where it belongs
(it is viewer-side rendering, not a metric).

## Files

- `ui/src/views/remote/RemoteControl.vue` — title, pill gating, tabs, Metrics pane
- `ui/src/composables/useRemoteControl.ts` — `storedMetricToggles`,
  `persistMetricToggles`, `DEFAULT_RC_METRICS`, `storedSharpenMode` default
- `ui/src/workers/rc-fsr-render.ts` — `normalizeSharpenMode` default
- `ui/src/__tests__/composables/useRemoteControl.spec.ts` — +5 tests, 2 updated

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Title prefers the display name; machine name kept visible in the subtitle
- [x] One checkbox per pill; defaults all-on except `paint`; per-key fallback;
      legacy flag honoured once (unit-locked)
- [x] FSR reads ON for a fresh profile
- [x] Settings dialog is tabbed with no control lost
- [x] Field: a renamed device shows its display name; unchecking a metric hides
      exactly that pill and survives reload; sharpening is on by default

## Field-verification log

- **2026-08-28 — deployed and verified in the shipped bundle.** Prod
  `v20260828-f98ca7c0b356`, `/health` 200. The live `RemoteControl` chunk
  (`RemoteControl-AWwCL_GH.js`, reached from the current `index-peS0x4jI.js`)
  carries `roomler-rc-metrics`, `roomler-rc-sharpen` and `display_name` — i.e.
  all four items are in the code the browser actually runs, not merely on
  master. ⚠️ This is a **deployment** check, not a field result: it proves the
  build reached prod, and says nothing about whether a renamed device reads
  correctly or a checkbox survives a reload. Those three remain open below and
  need a real session.
- **2026-08-29 — field-verified in a real browser against prod.** Driven
  through the operator's own signed-in Chrome, so this is the product as they
  meet it, not a harness:
  - **Title**: the viewer renders the admin-set display name **CORPLAP-1**,
    with the device's raw machine name — a corporate asset tag, redacted here —
    kept in the subtitle beside OS and version. The two are genuinely different
    strings on that device, which is the whole criterion: display name wins the
    title, machine name stays visible underneath.
    ⚠️ Do not "fix" this passage by writing the asset tag back in. An earlier
    revision printed it, hostname sanitisation rewrote it to the display name,
    and the sentence then read "renders CORPLAP-1 with CORPLAP-1" — evidence
    that had quietly stopped saying anything.
  - **Tabs**: the dialog opens on `VIDEO · DISPLAY · METRICS · SESSION`.
  - **Metrics**: all six checkboxes present. `Pipeline diagnostics` read
    CHECKED, which looked wrong for one beat and is exactly right: stored
    `roomler-rc-metrics` was **absent** while the legacy
    `roomler-rc-diag-hud` was `"1"`, so `paint` inherited the hand-set flag as
    designed. Unchecking `Bitrate` wrote the full object
    (`{codec,bitrate:false,fps,resolution,age,paint}`) and **survived a full
    page reload**.
  - **FSR default**: with `roomler-rc-sharpen` REMOVED — i.e. a fresh profile —
    Display reads **ON** ("Always sharpen (AMD FSR), even at 1:1"). Proven from
    a clean slate rather than from a stored choice.
  - Every preference touched was restored to its original value afterwards.
