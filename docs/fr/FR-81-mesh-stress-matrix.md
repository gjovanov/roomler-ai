# FR-81: Overlay stress matrix — latency, throughput and carrier stability from a throwaway VM

**Issue:** [#1546](https://github.com/gjovanov/roomler-ai/issues/1546) ·
**Status:** **closed 2026-09-25** — all nine criteria met. Reference run `20260924-155559` (every
target on agent 0.4.101): PASS 26/0, SSH 30/30, 0 transitions over 189 **measured** samples on
every pair. Docs: [`testing.md` → the overlay stress lane](../testing.md#the-overlay-stress-lane-fr-81).
⚠️ AC6's round-one evidence was 0 over *zero* samples and is withdrawn — see round three.

## Goal

Boot a **throwaway VM** into the fleet org and hammer the private mesh against real endpoints —
the three corporate laptops (CORPLAP-1/2/3) and the two fleet servers — measuring what the overlay
actually delivers: **latency distribution, packet loss, bulk throughput, SSH session reliability,
and carrier stability over time**, on **both** the direct and relay carriers. Repeatable as a
skill.

Everything the mesh promises is a *latency and stability* claim, and nothing in CI or the existing
matrices measures either. FR-61 proves a device installs and can ping once; FR-75 proves a profile
carries traffic once. Neither asks the mesh to keep working for ten minutes under load, and neither
records a distribution.

## Evidence — what the recon already showed

Measured 2026-09-08 from mars before any code was written. This is the design's foundation, because
it disqualifies the obvious matrix:

| host | `netcheck` | carrier now | direct achievable? |
|---|---|---|---|
| CORPLAP-1 | `stun/udp: NO MAPPING` · relay band **BLOCKED** · nat untyped | `relay:derp/tcp` | **No** — no UDP egress at all |
| CORPLAP-2 | `stun/udp: NO MAPPING` · relay band **BLOCKED** · nat untyped | `relay:derp/tcp` | **No** — no UDP egress at all |
| CORPLAP-3 | `stun/udp: ok` · relay band **BLOCKED** · nat **symmetric** | `relay:derp/tcp` | **No** — symmetric NAT, srflx ineligible (penalty 74.9) |
| zeus / mars | stun ok · relay band reachable · nat cone | `direct` | Yes |

⚠️ **`roomler why` says every tier is "eligible" for all three corp laptops — and that is not a
contradiction.** The ELIGIBLE column is the *local* end's willingness to offer a tier; the
**MEASURED PATH** rows are the truth. CORPLAP-2's measured direct path runs at **83 % loss**,
CORPLAP-3's at **100 %**. Reading "eligible" as "achievable" is the trap this table exists to
prevent, and a matrix that demanded `direct` from a corp laptop would report three permanent reds
for a mesh behaving exactly as designed.

**So the matrix asserts the carrier that is CORRECT for each host, never a fixed one**, and the
direct-vs-relay comparison is obtained where it is obtainable — against the fleet servers, with the
relay arm *forced* rather than hoped for.

## The matrix

One throwaway VM per **arm**; each arm sweeps every target.

| arm | how the carrier is obtained | targets |
|---|---|---|
| `direct` | VM's overlay defaults | zeus, mars → **direct** · CORPLAP-1/2/3 → **relay** (expected; the ladder is right) |
| `relay` | `overlay_direct=false` on the VM, forcing DERP | every target → **relay** |

The `direct` arm's corp-laptop rows are not a failure and not filler: they are the **control** that
shows the relay arm's numbers are not an artefact of the forcing knob.

### Per (arm, target) measurements

| check | what it measures | how |
|---|---|---|
| `carrier` | the carrier actually in use, plus `why` | `roomler peers` + `roomler why` |
| `latency` | p50 / p95 / max / loss over N samples | `roomler ping` ×N |
| `ssh` | session establishment reliability + cost | `roomler ssh <t> -- <trivial>` ×M, success rate + wall time |
| `throughput` | bulk bytes over the mesh, both directions, integrity-checked | `scp` via `roomler proxy` ProxyCommand, sha256 verified |
| `stability` | carrier transitions during the run | sample `roomler peers` every 10 s; count changes |

## Key design decisions

**The VMs join the FLEET org, not the vmtest org** — operator-approved, and unavoidable: the mesh
is tenant-scoped, so a vmtest-org VM cannot see a fleet-org laptop at all. This deliberately
suspends the vmtest rail "never the prod fleet org" for this lane only.

⚠️ **Enrollment is a STANDARD single-use token, not an FR-51 ephemeral key** — the fleet org has
`ephemeral_keys_enabled: false`, and flipping a security switch on the production org for a test is
a worse trade than deleting a row. Consequence: **there is no self-cleaning safety net**, so the
cell deletes its device row from an `EXIT` trap and the run asserts the fleet device count returns
to baseline. (Same shape as FR-68's org-B cell.)

⚠️ **The corp laptops' configuration is never touched.** Carrier pinning happens only on the
throwaway VM. Their `ssh_enabled: true` / `ssh_account_mode: daemon` state is read, relied on, and
left alone — which is also why `scp` works there at all (the sftp subsystem spawns as the daemon;
a `console_user` host would refuse).

⚠️ **These are someone's working machines.** Transfer size, sample counts and session counts are
bounded and configurable, and files land in the platform temp dir and are deleted. *(As built,
the sweep is not "minutes": both arms take about 2 h 50 min — mostly VM bring-up, 40 pings and a
VM-sender-limited 32 MiB transfer per target. The load on each target stays one SSH session or one
transfer at a time.)*

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] **AC1** a throwaway VM enrolls into the fleet org, appears on the mesh, and is fully removed
      at teardown (device row gone, VM destroyed, fleet count back to baseline).
      *Both cells: `fleet-residue PASS — back to 21 devices (baseline 21), no ghost left`, plus
      `teardown/org-baseline` on both orgs and no VM on zeus.*
- [x] **AC2** every target's carrier is recorded with `why` evidence, and each is asserted against
      what that host can actually achieve — never a fixed expectation.
      *`VMTEST-CARRIER` per target, `roomler why` captured to `/tmp/why-<t>.txt`, and the verdict
      is reachability + stability, never which carrier won.*
- [x] **AC3** latency is reported as a distribution (p50/p95/max/loss), not a single ping.
      *40 samples × 5 targets × 2 arms; 0.0 % loss on every one.*
- [x] **AC4** bulk transfer completes in both directions with a verified sha256, and yields a
      throughput number per arm.
      *32 MiB round trip, sha256 verified, on CORPLAP-1 and CORPLAP-2 in both arms
      (0.36–0.41 MiB/s). CORPLAP-3 reports `target-has-no-sftp-server`; zeus and mars serve no
      SSH at all — each named, none silent.* *Round three (SSH since enabled on the servers,
      operator-approved; `scp` is the transport): 8/8 possible round trips sha256-verified in
      `20260924-155559`; throughput is VM-sender-limited (~1 MiB/s on any carrier).*
- [x] **AC5** SSH session establishment is exercised repeatedly and reported as a success rate.
      *3/3 on all three corporate laptops in both arms — including CORPLAP-3, which had never
      produced a successful session in this lane before #1565.*
- [x] **AC6** carrier transitions are counted over the run — the stability claim gets a number.
      ~~*`carrier_transitions=0` on all ten (target × arm) pairs across ~3 ¼ hours.*~~
      **Withdrawn:** that zero — and rounds one and two's — was counted over **zero samples**; the
      sampler's output was never collected (round three). *Measured since the fix: the first real
      count, `20260923-182640`, caught a genuine ~70 s demotion (mars direct: 2 transitions / 177
      samples); `20260924-155559`: 0 / 189 on every pair, no stalled or unrecognised state.*
- [x] **AC7** the relay arm is *forced*, not hoped for, and the direct arm proves the forcing knob
      changed something.
      *mars: `carrier=direct` p50 0 ms in the direct arm → `carrier=relay:derp/tcp` p50 2 ms in the
      relay arm. Same VM image, same target, one config key.*
- [x] **AC8** the whole sweep runs from one command and is documented in a skill.
      *`vmtest.sh run --lane stress --host zeus`; the `meshstress` skill carries sixteen traps.*
- [x] **AC9** docs in the house style, linked from `docs/README.md` (the docs-before-close rule,
      #1401): the stress lane in `docs/testing.md`'s "CI & special lanes" — the matrix, the two
      arms and the one config key that forces relay (AC7), what each measurement means and why
      none asserts which carrier won (AC2), and round 2's two product fixes (#1559, #1565).
      AC8's `meshstress` skill does not satisfy this: it is gitignored, so nothing public
      documents the lane (nor the vmtest harness under it — that one is FR-61's to write).
      ⚠️ No fleet addresses in the doc: they are WHY the skill is gitignored, and they belong
      in the private docs repo.
      *[`testing.md` → "The overlay stress lane (FR-81)"](../testing.md#the-overlay-stress-lane-fr-81):
      the lane in the lanes table, a flow diagram, the two arms with `overlay_direct = false`
      anchored, every measurement and why the carrier is reported not asserted, the allow-list
      and sample-count rules for stability, all four product fixes the lane found (#1559,
      #1565, FR-83/#1597, #1573) with anchors, the reference run and the rails; indexed from
      `docs/README.md`'s `testing.md` row. No addresses, no real machine names.*

## Out of scope

Tuning anything. This measures; it does not fix. Also: no carrier pinning on any host but the
throwaway VM, no org-setting changes, no conclusions about corp-network policy beyond what
`netcheck` reports.

## Field-verification log

_(filled as runs land — every entry records what failed first)_

### 2026-09-08 — first full run, 22 PASS / 0 FAIL

Run `20260908-210103` on zeus, both arms, five targets each. No VM left; fleet org back to 21
devices (baseline 21) on both arms. Full table on #1546.

**`carrier_transitions=0` on all ten (target × arm) pairs** — no carrier flapped during either
sweep. That is the stability answer, and the first number that distinguishes a mesh which connects
once from one that holds.

**The forcing knob is proven**: mars measured `direct` at p50 **0 ms**, then `relay:derp/tcp` at
p50 **2 ms** under `overlay_direct=false`. Same host, same sweep. Without forcing, never-ratchet
would have made the relay arm a second direct arm.

Corp-laptop latency over DERP is **p50 47–57 ms**, p95 tail 55–116 ms, loss 0–2.5 % — usable, and
the tail is the number to watch across releases.

**Findings:** a VM running *on* zeus reaches zeus over DERP rather than LAN (2 ms, so cheap here,
but the lan tier never won); CORPLAP-3 and mars report `ssh_enabled: true` while having never
published an SSH host key, so `roomler ssh` correctly refuses and SSH reads as enabled-but-unusable;
and a grant-issued session gets a shell but **cannot `scp`**, because `roomler proxy` carries no
client identity.

**Five harness defects, each found only by running it:**

1. `roomler peers` CONN is field **5**, not 4 (a status bullet is field 1) — `$4` reported the IPv6
   *address* as a carrier. It looked like data.
2. The ssh arm swallowed stderr and reported a bare `ssh_ok=0`; the real answer was a POLICY gate.
3. That gate is `SshPolicy.can_originate`, default false — which forced the guest lane into
   `--phase enroll` / `--phase sweep`, since the row does not exist until enrol has run.
4. Corp-laptop SSH lands in **PowerShell**, so `echo ok` returns `ok\r` and `grep '^ok$'` failed on
   a session that worked — the metric read `ssh_ok=0 ssh_err="ok"`, contradicting itself.
5. The cleanup check grepped for the payload **path**, and PowerShell's not-found error quotes the
   path back — so a clean machine reported `LEFT_BEHIND`. It failed safe; the same shape inverted
   is how real leftovers get reported as gone. It now probes for a token.

### 2026-09-09 — round two: the transfer arm, and two product bugs

The operator enabled SSH on all three corp laptops and placed a client public key in each device's
`ssh_authorized_keys` — precisely what round one's third finding asked for. Re-running against that
turned the transfer arm from an accepted `NA` into a measurement, and found two defects in the
product on the way.

#### Round one's conclusion was only a third right

Round one recorded *"a grant session cannot `scp`, because `roomler proxy` carries no client
identity."* True as a mechanism — but it was **reasoning, not measurement**: the lane discarded
scp's stderr, so the missing identity was an inference from the docs rather than something the run
had seen. With the key in place and stderr kept, **four** independent things had to be right, and
the identity was one of them.

| # | wall | what it looked like |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **`scp` dials 22; roomler SSH listens on 2222** | `Error: connecting to <ip>:22 … Connection timed out`. OpenSSH hands its port to the ProxyCommand as `%p`, so `roomler proxy` faithfully dialled `:22`. ⚠️ `roomler proxy --help`'s own example has this gap. |
| 2 | **an identity** | with `-i` + `IdentitiesOnly`: `Authenticated to … (via proxy) using "publickey"`, and the device logs `sftp session started … run_as=daemon privileged=true`. |
| 3 | **the verdict must be the file, not scp's status** | see the first product bug below |
| 4 | **`/C:/…` on Windows** | a bare relative destination lands in the sftp default cwd, which is `C:\WINDOWS\system32`. |

#### Product bug 1 — `scp` exits 1 on a transfer that fully succeeded (#1559, merged)

`roomlerd`'s sftp subsystem was the only channel path that never sent an `exit-status`; the pty,
exec and every refusal do. OpenSSH reads it as the verdict on the transfer, logs `Exit status -1`
and exits 1:

```
scp rc=1
### did it land? (asked over SFTP, SAME identity that wrote it)
-rw-------    ? 0  0   2097152 Sep  9 21:30 /C:/Windows/Temp/rl-decide.bin
### sftp GET it back and compare
SHA MATCH — the upload was COMPLETE and CORRECT
```

`sftp` was unaffected — it never consults the channel status — which is exactly why this stayed
invisible. Anything that branches on scp's status retries or aborts work that is already done.

#### Product bug 2 — a corrupt host key wedges a device permanently (#1564 / #1565, merged)

CORPLAP-3 refused every SSH attempt with *"has not published an SSH host key … needs an agent that
has had SSH enabled at least once (rc.444+)"* — on a device running **0.4.96**, with
`ssh_enabled = true` and a key present in its config. The stored PEM is corrupt; its boundary line
against a working sibling:

| device | len | content |
|---|---|---|
| CORPLAP-3 | 41 | `-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----\r\r\` |
| CORPLAP-1 | 35 | `-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----` |

The daemon detects it and fails closed — correct — but the mint was gated on `is_none()`, and
`Some(garbage)` is not `None`, so it never replaced it. Two restarts (operator-approved) changed
nothing. ⚠️ The one WARN that explains it sits past the ≤64 KiB tail `roomler logs --grep` reads;
it took a whole-file `Select-String` to surface.

#### 🔑🔑 The cleanup check has now been wrong in three ways, and all three printed green

1. a path the checker was not looking in (sftp cwd ≠ shell cwd);
2. a not-found error that **quoted the path back**, so grepping for the path counted the error as a
   hit;
3. **an account that could not see the directory at all** — the transfer authenticates from the key
   list, so it runs as `ssh_account_mode = daemon` (SYSTEM) and writes `C:\Windows\Temp`, while a
   `roomler ssh` verification is a *grant* session that policy resolves to `console_user`:

```
--- did it land? ---
ABSENT
Test-Path : Zugriff verweigert
```

Removal and proof now run over SFTP on the transfer's own identity, and an unreadable listing is a
**third state** (`cleanup=UNVERIFIED`), never scored clean. That state then earned itself on the
very next run: with no identity the listing could not be read, the check refused to say "gone", and
a manual SFTP probe with the operator's key confirmed `not found` on both laptops — nothing left
behind. Under the previous code that situation printed `verified_gone`.

#### Two more harness defects, in this round's own code

6. **`sftp -b` echoes each command**, so its output opens with `sftp> ls -l <path>` — a line whose
   last field is *also* the path. Matching on the path alone matched the echo first, and `$(NF-4)`
   on a four-field line is `$0`, so every successful upload would have read `up=no`. Caught by
   unit-testing the awk against real sftp output before the run produced numbers.
7. **A readability test asked as the wrong user.** The lane runs as unprivileged `vmtest` while
   every consumer of the client key runs under `sudo`, and the key is staged 0600 root-only — so
   `[ -r "$CLIENT_KEY" ]` was false about a key that works. Measured in the live VM:
   `plain -r : FALSE` / `sudo -r : TRUE`. The same shape as defect 3 above, twenty lines away in
   the same file: **a permission answer read as an existence answer**, found once and not carried
   across. Both sites now call one `key_usable()` predicate.

#### Rail change, with operator approval

The standing *"nothing on a corp laptop is configured, restarted, or left behind"* was suspended
once, explicitly, to restart CORPLAP-3's daemon. The skill now records that enabling SSH on a
target, or restarting its daemon, is an **operator decision every time** — never inferred from the
fact that the matrix would be greener.

#### Known limit

CORPLAP-3 cannot transfer files even once #1565 ships: it has no `sftp-server.exe`. roomler spawns
the platform's binary rather than embedding one, so that a transfer runs as the session's account
instead of as the daemon — and on Windows that binary ships with the OpenSSH **Server** optional
feature, which a corp-managed laptop need not have. `Test-Path` reads `False` there and `True` on
both other laptops.

#### Result — 24 PASS / 0 FAIL, run `20260909-204509`

| target | arm | carrier | loss | p50 | p95 | max | SSH | 32 MiB round trip | transitions |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CORPLAP-1 | direct | relay:derp | 0 % | 55 | 79 | 247 | 3/3 | ✅ 0.37 / 0.36 MiB/s · `scp_rc=1` | 0 |

| mars | **relay** | **relay:derp** | 0 % | 2 | 3 | 6 | no host key published | — | 0 |

Zero loss on every target in both arms, and `carrier_transitions=0` on all ten pairs over ~3 ¼
hours — the number that separates a mesh which connects once from one that holds.

#### The matrix verified #1559 on its own, by accident and then on purpose

`agent-v0.4.97` rolled **during** the run, so the fleet was mid-rollout and `scp_rc` — added to the
metric as standing evidence rather than a one-off check — captured both sides:

| CORPLAP-1, the SAME device | agent | `scp_rc` | bytes |
|---|---|---|---|
| direct arm | 0.4.96 | **1** | `up=yes sha_match=yes` |
| relay arm | 0.4.96 | **1** | `up=yes sha_match=yes` |
| targeted re-test after its update | **0.4.97** | **0** | `remote_size=2097152 sha_match=yes` |

Three measurements on one laptop, one variable. The two 0.4.96 rows also rule out a timing race:
a race would vary *within* a device across arms, and it does not.

⚠️ The between-device comparison (CORPLAP-1 vs CORPLAP-2) came first and was the **weak** form —
two laptops differ in more than their agent version. It is recorded because it is what prompted the
within-device test, not because it settled anything.

#### Residue, checked as the identity that could actually see it

`cleanup=verified_gone` on CORPLAP-1/2 over SFTP; on CORPLAP-3 **neither identity reachable from
inside the VM can look** (sftp cannot start, and a `roomler ssh` grant session is `console_user`,
denied on `C:\Windows\Temp`), so it correctly reported `UNVERIFIED` and was checked from mars with
`roomler exec`, which runs as the daemon: **0 files** matching `roomler-stress*`. zeus and mars: 0.
Fleet org back to 21 devices, zero ghosts, no VM on zeus, k8s untouched.

### 2026-09-23 → 09-24 — round three: stability had never been measured, and an SSH race

#### 🚨 Rounds one and two counted stability over ZERO samples

*(Found 2026-09-10; fixed in the lane on 09-23; merged with #11 on 09-24.)*
`carrier_transitions=0` was printed for every pair across three runs (rounds one and two), and
every one of them was 0 over **zero** samples. The collection was one remote command —
`pkill -f 'roomler peers'; sudo cat /tmp/carrier.log` — and `pkill -f` matched the invoking shell's
own command line, which contained that exact pattern: it killed the shell it ran in, so the `cat`
never ran, the collected log was empty, and the counter found no transitions in nothing. The
sampler itself had worked all along. AC6's round-one evidence is withdrawn above.
Fixed in `roomler-ai-deploy` #11: collect first, kill second; the sampler's verdict is judged at
collection time on the lines captured; every result prints `transitions=<n>/<k>samples`.

Once real samples arrived, the counter called healthy peers flapping: the `CONN` column of
`roomler peers` carries **states** as well as carriers (`upgrading` is a make-before-break probe on
a relayed peer, plus `stalled` and `offline`). Transitions are now counted only between carrier
shapes on an allow-list (`direct`, `lan`, `relay:*`); states are tallied separately and anything
unrecognised is reported, never counted.

#### The first measured stability — `20260923-182640`, 26 PASS / 0 FAIL

0 transitions on every pair over 177–189 samples, except **mars direct: 2 / 177** —
`162× direct → 7× relay:derp → 8× direct`, a genuine ~70 s demotion and recovery (never-ratchet
doing its job). CORPLAP-3's relay arm logged 2 `stalled` and 36 `offline` samples as it left the
mesh for ~6 min at the end of its sweep, after its own measurements were taken.

#### Product bug 3 — a grant-issued SSH session could beat its own grant (#1597 → FR-83)

CORPLAP-2's direct arm: SSH **0/3**. The laptop's own log showed `rejected — no live grant`
3.3–4.4 s **before** `grant recorded`: the caller (the VM, on a fleet host close to the server)
dialled before the grant had crossed the laptop's slower control connection. FR-83 (#1601) makes
the server answer only after the device acknowledges the grant — shipped in 0.4.101, verified
below.

#### Product bug 4 — `roomler proxy`'s own `--help` recipe could not work (#1573)

Found while enabling SSH on the fleet servers for this lane: `Host *.roomler` hands the proxy
`<name>.roomler`, which it looked up verbatim. Fixed in 0.4.101.

#### ⚠️ One run's relay-arm SSH column was invalidated by a probe — `20260924-113449`

The confirming run for #11 (PASS 26/0; direct arm clean — SSH 15/15, `scp` 4/4 possible
sha-equal, 0/194 transitions) lost its relay-arm SSH to an FR-83 verification probe that PUT a
partial `ssh-policy` onto the live relay VM. The route is a full replace, and the lane grants the
VM `can_originate` through the same object: every relay-arm SSH attempt then answered *"not
permitted to originate"* (0/15, `scp` skipped) while the verdict stayed green, because the lane
reports a policy refusal as a measurement. Carrier, latency, loss and stability were unaffected.
The rail is now written down (`testing.md`, and trap 16 of the local skill).

#### Result — reference run `20260924-155559`, every target on agent 0.4.101 — PASS 26/0

| target | carrier (direct · relay) | loss | p50 / p95 ms (direct · relay) | SSH (dir · rel) | `scp` 32 MiB | transitions (dir · rel) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CORPLAP-1 | relay:derp · relay:derp | 0 % | 43/70 · 44/61 | 3/3 · 3/3 | ✅ sha256, both arms | 0/189 · 0/189 |
| CORPLAP-2 | relay:derp · relay:derp | 0 % | 56/79 · 57/94 | **3/3 · 3/3** | ✅ sha256, both arms | 0/189 · 0/189 |
| CORPLAP-3 | relay:derp · relay:derp | 0 % | 47/90 · 47/91 | 3/3 · 3/3 | ⛔ no `sftp-server` on the target | 0/189 · 0/189 |
| zeus | relay:derp · relay:derp | 0 % | 2/3 · 2/7 | 3/3 · 3/3 | ✅ sha256, both arms | 0/189 · 0/189 |
| mars | **direct** · relay:derp | 0 % | 0/0 · 2/8 | 3/3 · 3/3 | ✅ sha256, both arms | 0/189 · 0/189 |

From the five targets' own logs: **40/40 grant-issued sessions were recorded before they opened**
(leads 92–173 ms on the laptops, 7–28 ms on the servers), **0 rejected** — FR-83 in the field.
Sampler: 3591 lines per arm; no `stalled`, `offline` or unrecognised value on any pair. Fleet org
back to 21 devices after each arm.
