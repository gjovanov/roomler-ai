# FR-19: Peer relays — tenant-owned UDP relay nodes between direct and DERP

Status: **P0–P4c field-verified** — shipped through **0.4.20** (`agent-v0.4.20`); the whole path is proven on the primary tenant: **clk↔mars carried real traffic on `relay:org/udp` (~84 ms) via the scw-m2-asahi relay** (`forwarded=128`), then torn down on revoke back to the DERP floor. Capability + gates + mint + forward + revoke all field-verified 2026-08-29; live behind `overlay_org_relay` + `peer_relay_mode`, default off. Proposed 2026-08-28. Tracking issue: [`FR-19` (#805)](https://github.com/gjovanov/roomler-ai/issues/805).
Reference design: [Tailscale peer relays](https://tailscale.com/docs/features/peer-relay).
Sibling of FR-18 (#801) and FR-17 (#799) — both are about the *cost* of the relay path;
this FR is about **replacing that path with a better one** rather than tuning it.

## Goal

Let an org nominate one of its own enrolled nodes as a **peer relay**: a `roomlerd` that
forwards *ciphertext* between two other nodes of the same tenant over UDP, on a port the
operator chose, without decrypting anything and without the roomler control plane in the
data path at all.

```
LAN → direct-public → srflx hole-punch → relay{ ORG | TURN | DERP }
```

Three things this buys, in priority order:

1. **The API pod stops carrying video.** Today a relayed carrier is `relay:derp/tcp` —
   frames cross the `roomler2` pod, the same process serving HTTP, WS and mediasoup. That
   is in direct tension with the standing invariant in `CLAUDE.md`: *"The server
   coordinates but never carries plaintext… any design that would make the control plane a
   data path is wrong on those grounds alone."* DERP **is** that design, accepted as the
   **floor**. An org relay is the same escape hatch without the control plane in it.
2. **HQ-owned relaying** — an org with a well-connected headquarters box relays its branch
   and remote devices through *its own hardware*. See [§12](#12-hq-deployment--the-primary-use-case),
   which also states plainly what the relay operator **learns** — that half is not a
   footnote, it is a consequence of the deployment.
3. **Latency and throughput.** Tailscale's published result for the equivalent change:
   **2.24 → 27.5 Mbit/s (12.5×)**, **452 → 298 ms**
   ([blog](https://tailscale.com/blog/peer-relays-international-networks)).

**Non-goal, stated up front:** this does not replace DERP and must not be able to. DERP
over TLS:443 stays the floor (design commitment #2), and `pc55331` is why
([§2b](#2b-what-the-sweep-does-and-does-not-establish)).

## 2. Why now — field evidence, measured before any code

Taken **2026-08-28 from mars over Fleet RPC**, fleet at 0.4.10, before this spec was
written.

### 2a. Who is on the relay today

`sudo roomler peers` on mars, primary org, online peers:

| peer | carrier | RTT |
|---|---|---|
| `clk00017265` | **`relay:derp/tcp`** | 45 ms |
| `pc55331` | **`relay:derp/tcp`** | 56 ms |
| `goran-xmg-neo16-wsl-2` | **`relay:derp/tcp`** | 42 ms |
| neo16, jupiter, zeus, pc50045, rozalina-2, scw-m2-asahi, macbook-pro | `direct` | 0–137 ms |

Three of twelve online peers are relayed and every one is on **TCP** — a whole
head-of-line-blocking layer *below* the SCTP one FR-17 is about, on top of the 512-frame
`OUTBOUND_QUEUE` (`crates/tunnel-core/src/transport/derp.rs:53`) FR-18 measured at ≈1.8 s.

### 2b. What the sweep does — and does not — establish

`roomler netcheck` across the fleet, same session:

| host | `stun/udp` | `relay band/udp` | NAT | role here |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **mars** | ok | **reachable** | cone | ✅ relay server — utility tier, public IP |
| **jupiter** | ok | **BLOCKED** | cone | relay server *only after host-firewall provisioning* |
| **zeus** | ok | **BLOCKED** | cone | relay server *only after host-firewall provisioning* |
| **clk00017265** | ok | **BLOCKED** | **symmetric** | ✅ **client** — the target population |
| **pc55331** | **NO MAPPING** | *(derived, not probed)* | untyped | ❌ UDP is dead; stays on the DERP floor |
| pc50045 | ok | reachable | cone | already direct |
| scw-m2-asahi | ok | reachable | cone | already direct |

**Established:**

1. **`clk00017265` is the proof the feature is worth building.** Its NAT is *symmetric* —
   which is why direct fails and why no amount of hole-punching will ever fix it — and its
   STUN/UDP works. A relay on a port it can reach is precisely and only what it needs.
2. **`pc55331` is the proof DERP must stay.** `stun/udp: NO MAPPING` means no UDP path at
   all. No relay on any port helps it. ⚠️ Note its `relay band` cell is **derived, not
   measured**: `run_measurement` short-circuits `if !stun_udp { Some(false) }`
   (`crates/tunnel-core/src/overlay/netcheck.rs:205`). Marked as such because this spec's
   own §8 rule is that absence of measurement is never evidence of absence of capability.
3. **A high UDP port is a real risk** on the corp-managed hosts, and the codebase already
   says so: `crates/remote_control/src/signaling.rs:2063` — *"a corp egress that whitelists
   STUN:3478 still drops the ~10-13k relay band."*

**NOT established — the port choice is a hypothesis, not a finding.** ⚠️ An earlier draft
of this spec claimed *"UDP/3478 passes and 49152–65535 does not"* and presented the default
port as decided "on the strength of §2b". That overreads the instrument in two ways:

- `relay_band_udp` probes **coturn's configured relay band** (the comment above puts it
  around 10–13k), and it **never touches 40000**. A host that drops 10000–13000 may or may
  not drop 40000.
- The probe is not even a port test in the general case — see
  [§5](#5-port-selection--a-hypothesis-e2e-3-must-settle).

So: 3478 was the **starting hypothesis**, and **E2E-3 has now decided it — confirmed**. See
[§5](#5-port-selection--settled-by-e2e-3-3478) and the field log.

### 2c. jupiter and zeus will repeat the FR-4 failure if we let them

Both cluster hosts report `relay band/udp: BLOCKED` — their own host firewall, generated by
Ansible in `~/k8s-cluster-multi`. FR-4 (#776) is the cautionary tale, verbatim from
`CLAUDE.md`: the playbook *"flushes and rebuilds the COTURN chains — never hand-fix a host
without also fixing the vars, or the next playbook run reverts it."* Conference media was
dead on zeus for **weeks**, silently, for a hash-determined subset of tenants.

**Provisioning is therefore a phase (P5), not a manual prerequisite** — with the disruption
that phase itself causes stated honestly in [§10c](#10c-e2e-on-the-real-fleet--mars-zeus-jupiter).

---

## 3. The reference design (Tailscale), for orientation

Verified against `tailscale.com/net/udprelay` and `tailscale.com/disco`.

| element | Tailscale |
|---|---|
| Session identity | 32-bit **VNI**, allocated per ordered pair of disco public keys |
| Framing | **Geneve** (RFC 8926); `Control` bit separates handshake from data |
| Allocation | `AllocateEndpoint(discoA, discoB)` → `ServerEndpoint{ServerDisco, ClientDisco, LamportID, VNI, BindLifetime, SteadyStateLifetime, AddrPorts}`; idempotent per pair. **Reached over a control-plane-authenticated RPC**, not from an inbound UDP packet |
| Ordering | **`LamportID`**, a server-wide logical clock |
| Bind handshake | 3-way and **disco-sealed (NaCl box)** — `BindUDPRelayEndpoint` (0x04) → `…Challenge` (0x05) → `…Answer` (0x06). The sealing is what proves the binder holds the invited party's key |
| Challenge | BLAKE2s MAC over `vni ‖ generation ‖ invited-party key ‖ addr:port`, checked against the current *and previous* rotation window |
| Anti-tamper | The VNI is repeated *inside* the sealed payload, so a rewritten Geneve header is detected |
| Lifetimes | `defaultBindLifetime = 30 s` (3 legs × 10 s), `defaultSteadyStateLifetime = 5 min` idle |
| Forwarding | `addr:port` swap keyed by VNI once both `boundAddrPorts` are set |
| Authorization | ACL grant `tailscale.com/cap/relay` |
| Requirements | v1.86+ both ends; relay role unavailable on iOS / tvOS / Android |

⚠️ **Attribution correction.** An earlier draft presented "stateless MAC over the source
`addr:port` under a rotating secret, accepted for the current and previous window" as
copied-from-Tailscale prior art and called statelessness *"the single most important
security property to preserve."* That construction is **WireGuard's cookie-reply design**
(whitepaper §5.4.7), and it is defended here on its own merits, not on borrowed authority
— because Tailscale's allocation happens at an authenticated RPC, its relay has per-session
state before any UDP arrives, and so does ours (§1 step 3). **Statelessness is therefore a
DoS mitigation on the bind leg, not the security foundation.** The foundation is §4's key.

The two properties genuinely worth copying: **ciphertext-only forwarding** (the relay is
not a trust boundary) and **an authenticated bind** (§4).

### 3a. Wire — framing, and the socket it lives on

**The relay listens on its own dedicated UDP port** (§5), not on the node's overlay socket.
⚠️ An earlier draft said both in different sections; the dedicated port is the design,
because it means only relay traffic arrives there and the client side attaches through the
existing `RelayConn` seam (§6) rather than the shared carrier plane.

Framing is Geneve (RFC 8926) with the **`Opt Len` field pinned to 0** — a normative wire
invariant, enforced on receive. Two independent reviews landed on the same defect in the
first draft's claim that demux is *"unambiguous without a magic number"*; it is not:

| Geneve byte 0 | collides with |
|---|---|
| `0x00` (Opt Len 0) | STUN's first byte — separated only by `has_stun_cookie` requiring `pkt[4..8] == 0x2112A442`, and Geneve bytes 4–7 are **VNI(24) ‖ Reserved(8)** |
| `0x01`–`0x04` (Opt Len 1–4) | **WireGuard types 1–4, every one of them** |

What actually keeps WireGuard disjoint on the existing plane is a **four**-byte test —
`is_wg_shaped` (`crates/tunnel-core/src/overlay/wg.rs:2413`) requires `pkt[1..4] == 0`, and
Geneve's bytes 2–3 carry a nonzero Protocol Type. One byte is not enough, and
`payload_is_wg_or_disco` (`crates/tunnel-core/src/transport/derp.rs:222`) classifies on the
first byte alone.

So the rules are:

1. `Opt Len` **MUST** be 0; a frame with options is rejected, not parsed.
2. The Protocol Type is pinned to a fixed non-zero value, keeping bytes 1–3 non-WG-shaped.
3. **`VNI = 0x2112A4` is never minted**, so a relay frame can never present the STUN magic
   cookie at bytes 4–7.
4. Disjointness is proven over **WG × STUN × disco × Geneve**, table-driven — the standard
   `disco.rs:45-52` already sets: *"Shape disjointness (load-bearing — a false match steals
   a live datagram and blacks out the mesh)"*, locked by
   `disco_shape_is_disjoint_from_wg_and_stun`.

⚠️ The Geneve choice is **not** justified by tooling. An earlier draft claimed every capture
tool dissects it; in practice Geneve's Protocol Type is an EtherType, so Wireshark dissects
the 8-byte header and then fails on a payload that is not an Ethernet frame. Geneve is kept
for fixed offsets, a control bit and an option escape hatch — nothing more.

**The relay holds no key that decrypts anything.** It forwards WireGuard ciphertext between
two bound `addr:port`s selected by VNI.

### 3b. ⚠️ A new `RelayStrategyWire` tag would black-hole netmaps on every fielded agent

**This is the one change that can break the fleet silently. It ships first, alone, as P0.**

`RelayStrategyWire` (`crates/remote_control/src/signaling.rs:1985`) documents itself as safe
to extend — *"an unknown/absent value ⇒ the client falls back to its local computation, so
adding a variant later is forward-compatible"* (`:1976-1978`). **The comment is wrong about
the "unknown" half and the code does not implement it.** The enum is a plain
`#[derive(Deserialize)]` with `#[serde(rename_all = "kebab-case")]`, **no `#[serde(other)]`**
and no custom decoder. `#[serde(default)]` on `NetmapPeer.relay_strategy` (`:2117`) handles a
*missing* field, not an *unrecognised* one. An unknown tag is a hard serde error failing the
**entire enclosing `ServerMsg`**, and the agent's parse arm swallows it at `debug!`
(`agents/roomlerd/src/signaling.rs:1502`).

Add a variant carelessly and every pre-FR-19 agent **drops whole netmap frames** and stops
installing peers — a fleet-wide outage delivered by the server, visible only at `debug!`.

Four requirements, all in P0:

1. A **`supports_org_relay` hello bit** (`#[serde(default)] bool`, the shape of
   `supports_server_relay_strategy`, `signaling.rs:915`), gated at the existing both-ends
   gate in `server_relay_verdict` (`crates/api/src/ws/overlay.rs:1877`). The gate is
   **permanent**, not "until everyone upgrades".
2. `#[serde(other)] Unknown` (or a `deserialize_with` mapping unknown → `None`), making the
   documented behaviour real. **This is a bug fix worth landing even if FR-19 never ships.**
3. The variant stays a **unit variant**. The session is pushed **out-of-band** as its own
   `rc:overlay.relay_session` message keyed by node id. ⚠️ `RelayStrategyWire` derives
   **`Copy`** (`:1985`); a `session` payload would break that derive and ripple through
   `netmap.rs:92`, `relay_link.rs:1039-1042` and three by-value returns at
   `overlay.rs:1855/1876/1954` — and would also change the JSON from a string tag to a map.
4. A test decoding `"org-relay"` against a **pre-FR-19 `NetmapPeer` shape**.

---

## 4. The bind handshake — authenticated, then anti-spoof, then anti-amplification

⚠️ **The first draft of this spec was insecure here, and it is worth stating exactly how,
because the mistake is easy to repeat.** It drew:

```
client ──Bind{vni, generation}────────────────────────────▶ relay
client ◀─Challenge{ MAC(vni‖generation‖peer_pubkey‖addr:port) }── relay
client ──Answer{ challenge echoed }───────────────────────▶ relay   ⇒ bound
```

The client's only obligation there is to **echo a value the relay just sent it in the
clear**. That proves it can receive at an address — return-routability — and nothing else.
It copied the anti-DoS half of Tailscale's handshake and dropped the **disco-sealing**,
which is the half that proves identity. Consequences: the VNI is 24 bits and not secret, so
blind guessing against a relay holding ~1 000 sessions hits at ~6×10⁻⁵ per probe; the
pubkey in the MAC input is public netmap data; and anyone sharing the victim's egress
`addr:port` — *a co-worker behind the same corporate NAT, i.e. exactly the `clk00017265`
population this FR targets* — can take the slot. A stolen bind black-holes the pair,
receives the counterparty's ciphertext, and injects arbitrary UDP at its WireGuard socket.

⚠️ The first draft also cited `crates/api/src/ws/derp.rs:351` (the key-equality assertion on
DERP registration) as the precedent to copy — but that check works **because the WebSocket
underneath it is already authenticated** by the agent JWT (`derp.rs:234` `verify_agent_token`,
`:247` tenant match, `:284` refusal check). Copying the assertion without the channel copies
a check whose authentication came from somewhere else.

### The design

Three layers, each doing one job:

**(1) Authentication — a per-member secret delivered over the authenticated control WS.**
The mint already reaches both nodes on their agent WS (§1 step 3). It carries a
per-`(session, member)` `bind_secret`; the relay receives both in its copy of the mint.

```
client ──Bind{ vni, generation, nonce, tag₁ }─────────────▶ relay
                tag₁ = MAC(bind_secret, DOMAIN ‖ vni ‖ generation ‖ nonce)      ← no address, see below
client ◀─Challenge{ nonce, cookie }───────────────────────▶ relay
                cookie = MAC(cookie_key, DOMAIN ‖ vni ‖ nonce ‖ addr:port)
client ──Answer{ nonce, cookie, tag₂ }────────────────────▶ relay   ⇒ bound
                tag₂ = MAC(bind_secret, DOMAIN ‖ cookie ‖ nonce)
```

**Two keys with two different jobs, never derived from one another:**

| key | held by | proves |
|---|---|---|
| `bind_secret` | the **member** and the relay | *you are the node this session was minted for* |
| `cookie_key` | the **relay only**, rotating | *you can receive at the address you claim* |

**(2) Anti-spoofing** — the rotating cookie, accepted for the current and previous window,
so the relay keeps no per-attempt state. Rotation period ≤ the 30 s bind lifetime.

**(3) Anti-amplification** — ⚠️ **the bind path answers unauthenticated packets by design,
on UDP/3478, which is already among the most-sprayed reflection ports on the internet.** The
repo's own rule is stated at `crates/tunnel-core/src/overlay/disco.rs:69-70`: *"a reply is
exactly this long too, so the responder can never amplify (reply bytes == request bytes)"*,
implemented as a fixed `FRAME_LEN = 85`. FR-19 adopts it: **`Bind` is padded so
`len(response) ≤ len(request)`**, and an acceptance criterion asserts the ratio. Without
this, a customer's HQ box is a DDoS reflector at roughly 3×.

Plus a **per-source bind-attempt limiter** modelled on `unknown_init_fresh`
(`crates/tunnel-core/src/overlay/carrier_plane.rs:705`; `UNKNOWN_INIT_MIN_INTERVAL = 2 s`,
`UNKNOWN_INIT_MAX_SOURCES = 64`, `wg.rs:716`), with a counter and a reader.

### Construction details that are security-relevant

- ⚠️ **`tag₁` covers no address — corrected in P2c.** The first implementation of
  P2a (#881) put the observed `addr:port` into `tag₁`, matching an earlier draft of this
  section. The loopback test made the mistake obvious within minutes: **a client behind
  NAT cannot know its own mapped `addr:port` when it sends its first packet**, so it could
  never compute the value the relay expected — the handshake was unimplementable for
  exactly the population it exists for. The reference design binds the address at the
  *challenge* step for this reason, and so does this one now: the cookie covers the
  observed source, `tag₂` covers the cookie, and the relay re-derives the cookie against
  the observed source on the answer. The address is bound *by step 3*, the only step that
  grants anything. Cost: a captured `tag₁` replayed from elsewhere earns one 64-byte
  challenge to the replayer's own address, rate-limited — the posture of a probe echo,
  and it grants nothing. Tested in both directions.

- **`generation`** is the mint's monotonic re-issue counter for a `(pair, relay)` — defined
  here because an earlier draft used it inside a MAC without defining it anywhere.
- **A per-attempt random `nonce`**, echoed and MAC-covered, so a captured exchange does not
  replay for the rotation window (doubled by accepting the previous window).
- **Fixed-width or length-prefixed encoding with a `DOMAIN` separation constant.** Naive
  concatenation of a textual `addr:port` and a variable-width integer lets distinct tuples
  serialise identically (IPv4 vs IPv6 forms; digits sliding into the adjacent field).
- **Constant-time comparison, using `subtle`.** ⚠️ Every MAC compare in this tree today is a
  plain slice compare — `disco.rs:222` (whose comment says *"Constant-time-ish"* and is not),
  `wg.rs:2452`, `derp.rs:351`. For WireGuard's `mac1` that is defensible; its own doc calls it
  *"a ROUTER's pre-filter … not an authenticator"*. Here the MAC **is** the authenticator, so
  "model it on the existing one" would propagate the defect.
- **Membership.** A node may bind only into a session naming its own key in `members`.
- **Re-bind is permitted only under a valid `tag₁`.** ⚠️ This is load-bearing in *both*
  directions: forbid it and a symmetric-NAT host that rebinds its mapping — `clk00017265`,
  the target population — loses its session with no recovery short of a control-plane
  re-mint, the round trip this feature exists to avoid; permit it unauthenticated and it is
  a hijack primitive. The overlay already models this event (`Carrier::set_direct_dst`,
  `wg.rs:238`, repoints on cryptographic evidence; `Routed::SessionRoam`,
  `carrier_plane.rs:766`). Re-bind keeps the same VNI and updates one `boundAddrPort`.

### Lifetimes

**30 s** to complete the bind, **5 min** idle, and an **absolute `max_lifetime`**
independent of idle refresh. ⚠️ The absolute bound is not optional: `idle_deadline` is
*refreshed on traffic*, and with a 25 s WireGuard persistent keepalive
(`wg.rs:51 KEEPALIVE_SECS = 25`) it **never fires while a carrier is installed**. Without a
`max_lifetime` an active session has no expiry at all, and capacity is governed solely by
mint policy and `relay_max_sessions`.

**The relay re-clamps every deadline against its own clock** and its own ceilings — server
timestamps may only *shorten*. This is the Roomler SSH rule (`CLAUDE.md` P5: *"Agent
re-clamps the grant against its OWN clock"*), and it matters more here: the spec's own soak
tooling records pc50045 running **21.4 s** behind the dev box, against a 30 s bind deadline
compared across three hosts.

---

## Key design

### 1. The relay is a role of `roomlerd`, offered by the server, never assumed by a node

`CLAUDE.md` commitment #1: *"Best carrier that works, always measured, never assumed…
chosen by a **server verdict over measured `CapVector`s**. Heuristics may detect; they never
decide."*

1. A node opts in locally (`relay_server_enabled`, `relay_server_port`) and advertises the
   capability verb `relay-server` through `models::RpcCap` — variant → `wire()` arm → `ALL`
   entry. ⚠️ Equality matching only: `relay` is a prefix of `relay-server`, the
   `ssh`/`ssh-consent` trap. (`RpcCap::ALL` is `[RpcCap; 6]` at `models.rs:315`, a
   fixed-size array — the **compiler** forces the entry, not a test.)
2. An admin approves the device — the offer is not the grant (§2, gate 3).
3. The **server** mints the session and pushes it to both nodes plus the relay.
4. The nodes bind, measure, and report.

Verdict machinery to extend, verified against master:

| what | anchor |
|---|---|
| Server verdict entry point | `crates/api/src/ws/overlay.rs:1851` `server_relay_verdict` |
| …delegating to the pure decision | `overlay.rs:1944` `relay_verdict_core` |
| Measured caps supersede presence | `overlay.rs:1893-1902` (in `verdict_from_nodes`, `:1872`) |
| Wire verdict enum | `crates/remote_control/src/signaling.rs:1987` `RelayStrategyWire` |
| Client-side cascade consuming it | `crates/tunnel-core/src/overlay/relay_link.rs:1016` `relay_strategy` |

### 2. Gates — and an honest account of which are actually armed

```
PeerRelaySession {
  vni:           u24,             // GLOBALLY unique per relay node — see below
  relay_node:    ObjectId,
  tenant_id:     ObjectId,        // stored in the relay's entry, not encoded in the VNI
  endpoints:     Vec<SocketAddr>, // measured + static, SSRF-validated (§5)
  members:       [(WgPublicKey, BindSecret); 2],
  generation:    u64,
  lamport:       u64,             // server-owned
  bind_deadline / idle_deadline / max_lifetime
}
```

⚠️ **VNI scoping — the first draft was self-contradictory** (`// unique within the relay
node, per tenant`, then *"the VNI space is per-tenant-scoped"*). Those are mutually
exclusive: per-tenant allocation on a shared node lets two tenants hold the same VNI, and
the Geneve header has no tenant field, so the relay's demux key is ambiguous across exactly
the boundary that matters. **The VNI is globally unique per relay node**, and `tenant_id`
lives in the session entry. This is the lesson the carrier plane already learned in the
opposite direction: `alloc_index` is *"a process-unique 24-bit session index"*
(`carrier_plane.rs:1000`) precisely because *"with N orgs on one socket, a source-keyed table
cannot tell them apart"* (`:13-21`). It is also typed **`u24`**, not `u32`: the wire field
is 24 bits, so two `u32`s differing above bit 23 would alias to one session.

| # | gate | owner | actual default |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `OverlayNetwork.peer_relay_mode` (`off`\|`warn`\|`on`) | the org | **`off`** ✅ |
| 2 | overlay ACL `relay` capability, src → relay node | the policy author | ⚠️ **inert today** |
| 3 | `Agent.peer_relay_policy` — approval needs `MANAGE_AGENTS` **and** `EXEC_DEVICE` (see ⚠️ under *Permissions*) | the fleet admin | **deny** ✅ |
| 4 | agent-local `relay_server_enabled` | the device owner | **off** ✅ |

⚠️ **Gate 2's default is not "deny" — it is "off, and permits everything."** The first draft
claimed four default-deny gates; there are three. `OverlayAclMode` derives `#[default] Off`
(`crates/remote_control/src/models.rs:1407`), documented as *"every node sees every peer…
The default, so enabling the feature never breaks a live mesh"*; `Warn` *"ship[s] the
permissive netmap"*; and `CLAUDE.md`'s own open-issues list records that **nothing has ever
run under `enforce` in the field**. Tailscale's `cap/relay` is an *affirmative grant*; a
mode-conditioned visibility shaping is not the same thing. Two options, and this FR takes
the first:

- **(taken)** the relay grant is an **affirmative capability evaluated regardless of
  `acl_mode`** — the honest analogue of `cap/relay`;
- (rejected) leave it mode-conditioned and document that gate 2 is inert until a tenant
  reaches `enforce`.

⚠️ **"Fail closed" is not implementable through the API the first draft prescribed.**
`load_acl` returns `AclCtx` — **not** `Result` — and its error path returns `AclCtx::off()`,
logging *"failing OPEN"* (`overlay.rs:1770-1773`, `:1786`). That is byte-identical to a
tenant that genuinely has ACLs disabled, so a caller shaped like the existing precedent
(`overlay.rs:719-743`) takes the "no ACL configured" branch on a Mongo blip and **grants**,
while its author believes it fails closed. Required: a `try_load_acl(…) -> Result<AclCtx, _>`
for the new gate, with the two existing callers keeping their posture via an explicit
`.unwrap_or_else(|_| AclCtx::off())` — which also turns their fail-open into a visible
decision. Same for `overlay_source_of` (`overlay.rs:1793`), which swallows both errors
(`.ok()` → `owner_user_id: None`; `unwrap_or_default()` → empty roles), silently failing to
match a `UserId`/`RoleId`-scoped grant with no log — against `feedback_log_every_silent_drop`.

**Permissions.** ⚠️ Exit-node approval requires `MANAGE_AGENTS`
(`crates/api/src/routes/overlay_route.rs:310`, checked at `:328`), which **is** in `DEFAULT_ADMIN`
(`crates/db/src/models/role.rs:104`), and writes no audit row. Nominating a relay makes a
device a traffic chokepoint and a metadata observation point for the whole tenant (§12), so
it belongs in the class `role.rs` already draws a line around — *"an admin should see every
command the fleet ran without silently gaining the power to run one"*, which is why
`EXEC_DEVICE` (1<<27) and `SSH_DEVICE` (1<<29) are excluded. Therefore:

⚠️ **Corrected in P3a (2026-08-29): there is no free permission bit, so there is no
`RELAY_DEVICE`.** The spec and its security review both assumed bits 31 and 32 were
available. They are not: the UI mirror (`ui/src/utils/permissions.ts`) checks masks with
JavaScript's **signed 32-bit** bitwise ops — `1 << 31` is negative, `1 << 32` wraps to 1 —
and its spec pins the ceiling at bit 30 *by design*. A bit defined server-side that the UI
cannot render is a permission nobody can grant from the product, which is worse than no
bit. So, until the mask moves to `BigInt` (#888):

- **Relay approval requires `MANAGE_AGENTS` and `EXEC_DEVICE`.** Coherent rather than a
  hack: an `EXEC_DEVICE` holder can already run `roomler config set relay_server_enabled
  true` on any exec-enabled device as root, so the coupling grants nothing new. What it
  cannot express is an org that wants relay approvers who may *not* run root commands —
  that needs the dedicated bit, which needs #888.
- **The relay audit reads behind `VIEW_EXEC_AUDIT`**, keeping the exec pairing.

The bullets below describe the design *once #888 lands*:

- **`RELAY_DEVICE`** — approval; **not** in `DEFAULT_ADMIN`; required *in addition to*
  `MANAGE_AGENTS`.
- **`VIEW_RELAY_AUDIT`** — in `DEFAULT_ADMIN`, mirroring `VIEW_EXEC_AUDIT` (1<<28) and
  `VIEW_SSH_AUDIT` (1<<30).
- ⚠️ `ALL = (1 << 31) - 1` (`role.rs:133`) must be bumped in the same commit;
  `all_contains_every_named_permission` will force it.
- **The approval itself is audited** — it is the privilege-granting action, and the
  exit-node precedent auditing nothing is a gap to not copy.

**Rate limiting.** ⚠️ `handle_overlay_relay_request` has **none** — `crates/api/src/ws/overlay.rs`
contains zero `RateLimiter` references. Both precedents this FR claims equivalence with do
enforce one, deliberately after the identity gates so refusals are attributable:
`agent_exec.rs:320` (30/min) and `agent_ssh.rs:396` (20/min). `CLAUDE.md` records why:
*"The HTTP `tower_governor` is per-IP and never saw the device-originated
`rc:rpc.request` / `rc:ssh.request` WS legs, so those had no ceiling at all."* A mint is
another device-originated WS leg and is **more** expensive, because it writes state onto a
*third* device. Add a `(requesting node, relay node)` limiter with a `RateLimited` deny
reason. **P3b:** `AppState::relay_rate_limiter` + `peer_relay_limits::MINT_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE`
= 30 (the exec precedent, so a fleet boot — one requester asking for every unreachable peer
through the same relay inside a minute — fits under it); the check site lands with the mint
in P3c, after the identity gates, so a refusal is attributable and audited.

**Multi-org: relay serving is PRIMARY-ORG ONLY, enforced.** ⚠️ The first draft said a device
*"may serve N tenants"* and, two sentences later, that it *"should follow"* the primary-only
rule. `docs/multi-org.md:260` makes exit-node and netstack primary-only because they are
**host-global singletons**; a UDP listener on a host-global port is exactly that. And
`:106-108` adds the trust half for `rc:agent.update`: *"a secondary org's admin must not be
able to force-update a shared binary"* — a secondary org's admin minting sessions onto the
device owner's listener is the same escalation. Refuse the mint server-side for a
secondary-org node, and drop a relay grant arriving on a secondary org's WS agent-side.

**Gate 4 delivery.** ⚠️ `docs/remote-config.md` opens with the measured consequence of
exactly this shape: *"the reason both features are still off nearly everywhere: the last
gate is the one nobody can reach."* An HQ relay is precisely a box an admin may not have
hands on. Decision: `relay_server_enabled` **stays device-local and unpushable**, and §12's
operator checklist carries the local-enable step. If that friction proves fatal in the
field, routing it through remote config requires `MANAGE_AGENTS` **and** `EXEC_DEVICE`
(`RELAY_DEVICE` once #888 lands) —
and the "survives a compromised server" claim for gate 4 must then be dropped rather than
kept as a property the delivery mechanism contradicts.

### 5. Port selection — **SETTLED by E2E-3: 3478**

**`relay_server_port = 3478`.** Field-measured 2026-08-28, not inferred. Geneve-shaped
64-byte frames (`Opt Len = 0`, pinned protocol `0x7788`, deliberately **not** STUN-shaped)
sent to a responder on mars:

| host | netcheck | **3478** | 11000 (coturn's relay band) | 41641 (high port) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **clk00017265** — symmetric NAT, corp-managed, permanently on `relay:derp/tcp` | `relay band/udp: BLOCKED` | ✅ **PASS** | ❌ FAIL | ❌ FAIL |
| **pc50045** — Check Point corp, cone | band reachable | ✅ PASS | ✅ PASS | ✅ PASS |
| **pc55331** | `stun/udp: NO MAPPING` | ❌ FAIL | ❌ FAIL | ❌ FAIL |

Arrivals were confirmed at the responder, not merely inferred from a client timeout —
clk's frame landed from `192.164.201.1:10400`, matching the `MEASURED PATH` its own
`roomler why` reports.

Three results, in order of consequence:

1. **3478 is the only port the motivating host can use.** `clk00017265` reaches 3478 on an
   *arbitrary public IP* and **nothing else**. A relay on any other port cannot serve it.
2. **The STUN-ALG worry did not materialise** — a non-STUN-shaped payload passed on 3478.
   The test was still run Geneve-shaped, because a generic UDP echo would not have
   distinguished the two and the risk was real until measured.
3. **41641 is not a viable alternative**, so the high-port fallback is dead for this
   population.

⚠️ **This narrows the codebase's own claim.** `signaling.rs:2063` says a corp egress
*"whitelists STUN:3478 still drops the ~10-13k relay band"*. Measured, clk drops **11000
and 41641** — it whitelists *only* 3478, so the constraint is "one allowed port", not "all
but the relay band".

**443/UDP** stays the documented fallback for hosts where 3478 is unavailable — which,
per the next warning, includes our own.

⚠️⚠️ **A relay host must be checked for DNAT, not just for a free socket — and `ss` will
lie to you.** The first probe of this matrix *failed* on 3478 and nearly produced the
opposite conclusion. The cause was not the corp egress: mars's `COTURN_DNAT` chain
redirects UDP/3478 on **both** public IPs to the coturn VM in `PREROUTING`, before any
local socket is consulted. `ss -ulnp` showed 3478 free, `HOST_FW_INPUT` showed it
ACCEPTed, and a bound listener still received nothing. The same chain consumes
**10000–13000** and **443 on `.74`**. Consequences:

✅ **The relay host is `scw-m2-asahi` (`62.210.194.66`)** — measured 2026-08-28, after mars
was ruled out below. It is a Scaleway Apple-M2 running Fedora Asahi: a public IP, UDP/3478
free, **no DNAT on it**, and firewalld the only gate. With 3478 opened, **`clk00017265`
reached it** — arrival confirmed server-side from its own srflx `192.164.201.1:10400` — as
did `pc50045`. `pc55331` did not, as expected: it has no UDP anywhere.

⚠️ **The two home-LAN candidates were measured and REJECTED, not assumed.**
`MacBook-1` (`gorans-macbook-pro-local-daemon`) and `neo16` share one consumer NAT behind
`37.63.112.129`. With a listener bound on the MacBook's `0.0.0.0:3478` and four datagrams
sent from mars to that public IP, the listener reported **`NO-INBOUND (timeout)`** — there
is no port forward, so neither can serve a relay to anyone off that LAN. Two traps caught
on the way, both of which would have produced a false answer:
`timeout` does not exist on macOS (the first listener never ran and its "33 bytes received"
was the shell's own error text), and a first probe was sent from `pc55331`, which has no
UDP at all and would have failed against a working host. A relay on a roaming laptop behind
a residential NAT is also the wrong shape regardless of reachability.

- **mars cannot host an org relay on 3478** without displacing coturn — the one port the
  target population can reach is already taken on the fleet's most natural relay host.
  E2E-1 must therefore either pick a host without coturn DNAT or move coturn first.
- This is the FR-4 class recurring: a host-level DNAT eating a port silently. Add a
  `iptables -t nat -S | grep <port>` check to the relay-host preflight, not just a bind
  attempt, and make the daemon **refuse to start the relay and log why** rather than
  binding a port it will never receive on.
- ⚠️ **40000 is likewise not testable on jupiter/zeus** — `coturn_dnat_rules[*].port_ranges`
  includes `"40000:49999"` on every roomler-ai-hosting node. Use 41641 there.

**Reachability is new plumbing, not a generalised probe.** ⚠️ The first draft said the
existing `relay_band_udp` probe *"generalises"* and *"becomes a `CapVector` field"*. Both
halves are wrong:

- `probe_relay_band` (`netcheck.rs:144`) takes `alloc: &dyn RelayConn` — a **live coturn TURN
  allocation** — bootstraps permissions through it and reads the *allocation* for the echo.
  **Coturn is the responder.** An org relay must answer the probe itself; that is a new
  protocol, and it is why P1 ships a bind-only responder.
- `CapVector` (`netcheck.rs:60`) is four scalars in a **single process-global slot**
  (`:213`), shipped once per node. Reachability is a **pairwise (node × relay × port)** fact
  — an N×M table. It cannot be a `CapVector` field; it needs its own report
  (`rc:overlay.relay_probe`).

**SSRF.** ⚠️ Once the probe target becomes an operator- or server-supplied `SocketAddr`, an
oracle-returning internal port scanner exists: set a static endpoint to `169.254.169.254:80`
or an RFC1918 address and **every agent in the tenant — running as SYSTEM/root inside the
customer's corp LAN — probes it and reports reachability.** The countermeasure is already
written for this exact class: `validate_push_endpoint` (`crates/api/src/routes/push.rs:20`),
*"every resolved address must be globally routable (loopback / RFC1918 / 169.254 metadata /
CGNAT-and-overlay 100.64/10 / ULA / link-local v6 / v4-mapped forms all refused)"*. Validate
`endpoints` and `relay_static_endpoints` at approval time with that ruleset, re-check after
resolution, and constrain each node's probes to endpoints the server minted for **it**.

### 6. Carrier integration — a third `RelayKind`, **not** a fifth tier

⚠️ **This inverts the first draft's central design decision, and the inversion removes most
of the FR's implementation risk.** The first draft proposed a new `orgrelay` tier at BASE
230 between `srflx` (260) and `relay` (200), with a "rejected alternative" of folding it
into the relay tier. The rejection reason was: *"collapsing a 230-vs-200 preference into one
row makes `roomler why` unable to answer 'why am I on DERP when there is a relay right
there'."*

**That reason describes the status quo the codebase already accepts.** `explain`
(`path.rs:917`) iterates `DIRECT_TIERS.chain(once(&DirectTier::Relay))`, and
`base(Relay) = B_RELAY` for **both TURN and DERP** — so `roomler why` *already* cannot
distinguish a 52 ms coturn hop from a 175 ms DERP hop. That distinction has never lived in
the tier ladder; it lives in `PeerInfo.relay_kind` + `relay_transport`, rendered by
`relay_qualified_label` (`localclient.rs:1028`) as `relay:{kind}/{transport}`.

So the design is:

- **`RelayKind::Org`** joins `Turn` and `Derp` (`crates/tunnel-core/src/overlay/relay_link.rs:152`).
  `relay:org/udp` appears in the CONN column **for free** via `relay_transport_info`
  (`wg.rs:204`), with `relay_server()` supplying `relay_via`.
- **The transport is a fourth `RelayConn` impl.** `Carrier::Relay { conn: Arc<dyn RelayConn>, dst, dead }`
  (`wg.rs:155`) is already fully opaque to the send path, and `Carrier::send` (`wg.rs:410`)
  just calls `conn.send_to(buf, dst)`. DERP plugs in exactly this way — `impl RelayConn for
  DerpConn` (`transport/derp.rs:268`), `DerpMux::conn_for` (`derp.rs:420`) vending one per
  peer off a shared connection — and there are already **three** production impls
  (`DerpConn`, `TurnRelayConn` `transport/relay.rs:348`, `UdpRelayConn` `:491`). An org relay
  is a fourth, plus an `OrgRelayMux` shaped like `DerpMux`.
- **`relay_strategy` (`relay_link.rs:1016`) gains a branch**; the server verdict picks Org
  over Turn/Derp when a session exists.

⚠️ **What this avoids is the whole point.** The first draft's §9 named
`send_ip_packet` (`wg.rs:907`) as *"the send path that must learn 'via peer X'"*. It is not:
relay carriers already get a dedicated per-peer recv task (`wg.rs:1421`) and never touch the
carrier plane's shape demux. `send_ip_packet`, `send_to_peer`, `SendPeer` and the `Router`
need **zero changes**. The first draft also pointed the receive arm at
`CarrierPlane::route_by_index` (`carrier_plane.rs:738`) — which takes a WireGuard receiver
index *already extracted from a parsed WG packet* (its three callers are `handle_datagram`'s
arms at `:561-563`), so a Geneve frame can never reach it; and its `expected_src` contract
(`:766-800`) would trip the roam machinery on packets arriving from the relay's address.

A new tier would additionally have required navigating four hazards, three of them **silent**:

| hazard | anchor | why it fails silently |
|---|---|---|
| `is_direct()` = `!matches!(self, Relay)` | `lifecycle.rs:96` | a new variant reads as **direct** everywhere: `rx_stale_deadline` gives it the 60 s direct deadline (`:146`), `establish.rs:2596` makes **both ends initiate** the WG handshake, `:2562` books a direct-tier failure on demote-follow |
| `is_sticky` `_ =>` catch-all | `path.rs:825` | silently inherits LAN/public's 2-strike escalation |
| `suppression_half_life` `_ =>` catch-all | `path.rs:285` | same |
| `PathAction` / `Incumbent` | `path.rs:440`, `:428` | neither can represent an org relay; `decide` (`:1021`) iterates `DIRECT_TIERS` and its executor dials directly (`establish.rs:1312`, `:1400`, `:1472`) — an org relay needs a server mint plus an async 3-way bind, so `Install(OrgRelay)` would be handed to a direct-dial executor |

⚠️ **And one of the first draft's own "blockers" was a misreading, retracted here.** It
claimed the eligibility floor `base(tier) - penalty >= B_RELAY - ELIGIBILITY_EPS`
(`path.rs:850`) would leave a BASE-230 tier only **30 points** of penalty headroom against
srflx's 60. But the penalty is **scaled to each tier's own headroom** —
`weight(tier) = 2.0 * (base(tier) - B_RELAY)` (`path.rs:274-278`), whose doc states the
invariant: *"eligibility … is re-crossed after exactly one half-life."* Every tier is
suppressed for exactly one half-life; there is no asymmetry, and both "fixes" the first
draft proposed would have destroyed that invariant for every tier. The real constraint —
which stands, and is the reason to defer tier work at all — is that `weight()` is *derived
from* `base()`, so a new tier's base cannot be tuned independently of how aggressively it is
suppressed.

**Deferred, not abandoned:** if measurement later shows the selector genuinely mis-ranks an
org relay against TURN/DERP, the tier surgery above is the follow-up, opened with the field
evidence that justifies it.

### 7. Never self-wedge, never remove the floor

- **The floor is unconditional.** DERP registration is never torn down because a relay came
  up. `pc55331` must be measurably unaffected.
- **Never ratchet.** A pair on `relay:org` keeps re-attempting direct on the existing cadence.
- **The relay node protects itself.** `relay_max_sessions` (default **64**) and
  `relay_max_bitrate_per_session`; the relay's own carriers are exempt from its forwarding
  budget. An org must not be able to cost its HQ box its own remote access.
- **Failure is a downgrade, never a black hole**, convicted by `sweep_carrier_health`
  (`runtime/establish.rs:271`). ⚠️ FR-9's lesson: the dangerous bug was never "the carrier
  failed", it was *"both ends held a hold-down and went mutually deaf"* (#746).
- **Revocation is a push, not an expiry.** ⚠️ The first draft had no unmint at all, so
  flipping `peer_relay_mode` to `off` would have left live sessions forwarding indefinitely
  (§4: `idle_deadline` never fires under keepalive). `rc:relay.revoke{session_id}` fires on
  mode-off, ACL revoke, policy revoke and device removal — the shape `release_overlay_node`
  already uses, and `project_overlay_acl`'s recorded lesson that revocation **must** ship
  `removes`.
- **Privilege context.** ⚠️ `roomlerd` runs as **SYSTEM on Windows, root under systemd**.
  This FR puts a parser for attacker-controlled bytes, on an unauthenticated public UDP
  port, in that address space — alongside remote desktop, tunnels and SSH. Rust bounds
  memory safety, but a **panic on the receive path takes down the whole daemon**. So: the
  Geneve/bind parser must be total, proven by **fuzz/proptest over arbitrary byte strings**
  (not one table test), and the relay receive loop is wrapped in `catch_unwind` so a parser
  bug degrades the relay rather than the node. Compare rc.433's reasoning: *"A capability
  probe is untrusted third-party code by definition … and does not belong in the daemon's
  address space."*

### 8. Observability — shipped with its reader, per counter

⚠️ **The precedent:** FR-18's field log records `dropped_stale` *"could NOT be evaluated —
the counter was added without a reader"*. Still true: `stale_drops()`
(`transport/derp.rs:407`) has zero consumers in the tree.

| surface | addition |
|---|---|
| `roomler peers` | `CONN` reads `relay:org/udp` — free via `relay_qualified_label` (`localclient.rs:1028`) |
| `roomler peers --json` | `relay_kind: "org"`, `relay_via`, `relay_endpoint` (`PeerInfo`, `crates/localapi/src/lib.rs:346`) |
| `roomler why <peer>` | the relay row names the kind; the tier ladder is unchanged (§6) |
| `roomler netcheck` | relay node: `relay server: listening :3478, N sessions` |
| relay node | per-session `packets_rx`/`bytes_rx`, **one labelled counter per refusal reason** — bad MAC, unknown VNI, wrong tenant, at-capacity, expired, unbound-source — each with a `NodeStatus` reader. ⚠️ One counter for six causes cannot tell an attack from a misconfiguration during a flood |
| process-global | `ORG_RELAY_SESSIONS_OPENED_TOTAL` / `_CLOSED_TOTAL` only. ⚠️ **Not a gauge**: `evidence.rs:1-4` is *"cumulative since daemon start — consumers DIFF two readings, never judge absolutes"*. The live session count is a `NodeStatus` field |
| server | `peer_relay_audit` (90 d TTL) — every **approval**, mint and refusal, reason enumerated, written in one place via `decide() -> Result<Granted, DenyReason>`, read behind `VIEW_EXEC_AUDIT` (`VIEW_RELAY_AUDIT` after #888). **P3b:** `GET …/peer-relay-audit` (`?agent_id=`), one row shape for both actions (`action: approve \| mint`) so "who made this device a relay, and what went through it?" is one query on `agent_id`; `PeerRelayDenyReason` is the enumerated vocabulary (12 arms, wire-locked) |

⚠️ An empty `relay_via` is not evidence of "no relay available" — it may mean the node never
measured (`signaling.rs:1795`).
⚠️ `relay_via` must resolve from **the requesting tenant's own node row**. A multi-org
device has N per-tenant rows with independently-set names; resolving from any other would
leak tenant A's label for a shared device to tenant B, against `docs/multi-org.md:87-90`.

### 9. Where the code goes — implementation map

Verified against `origin/master`, 2026-08-28.

| change | file:line |
|---|---|
| Relay sub-kind gains `Org` | `crates/tunnel-core/src/overlay/relay_link.rs:152` `RelayKind` |
| **Transport: a 4th `RelayConn` impl + `OrgRelayMux`** | model on `transport/derp.rs:268` (`impl RelayConn for DerpConn`) and `derp.rs:420` (`conn_for`). **P4a:** `crates/tunnel-core/src/overlay/orgrelay/client.rs` — `bind` / `bind_any` (the member's half of §4; a Challenge is the success signal, the wire has no ack) + `OrgRelayConn: RelayConn` (8-byte header on send, only this session's frames from the relay's address on recv, synthetic peer addr, `close()` → dead latch). One socket per session rather than a mux: the relay binds a member by observed source, so each session needs its own source anyway |
| Client cascade branch | `relay_link.rs:1016` `relay_strategy` |
| Server verdict | `crates/api/src/ws/overlay.rs:1851` / `:1944` |
| Mint + ACL gate + rate limit | `overlay.rs:693` `handle_overlay_relay_request` (cross-tenant `:705-717`, ACL `:719-743`) — **P3c:** it now calls `crate::ws::org_relay::maybe_mint` beside the TURN grant |
| **The mint itself (P3c)** | `crates/api/src/ws/org_relay.rs` — `maybe_mint` (gate 1 + idempotency + audit), `plan_mint` (gates 2–5, candidate ranking by probe reports), `revoke_where` + the four trigger wrappers, `reconcile_acl` (on every policy refan), `handle_relay_probe`; `OrgRelayState` holds sessions / per-relay VNI cursors / the Lamport clock / join extras / probes, pod-local |
| Netmap shaping | `overlay.rs:1982` `shape_peer` |
| Wire model | `crates/remote_control/src/signaling.rs:2007` `NetmapPeer`; `:1985` `RelayStrategyWire` |

| Carrier health / demotion | `crates/tunnel-core/src/overlay/runtime/establish.rs:271` `sweep_carrier_health` |
| Shape disjointness standard | `overlay/disco.rs:45-52`; `is_wg_shaped` `wg.rs:2413`; fix `payload_is_wg_or_disco` `transport/derp.rs:222` |
| Anti-amplification standard | `overlay/disco.rs:69-70` (`FRAME_LEN = 85`) |
| Per-source limiter model | `overlay/carrier_plane.rs:705` `unknown_init_fresh`; `wg.rs:716-717` |
| SSRF validator to reuse | `crates/api/src/routes/push.rs:20` `validate_push_endpoint` |
| Permission bits + `ALL` bump | `crates/db/src/models/role.rs:104`, `:133` |
| CLI surfaces | `agents/roomler-cli/src/localclient.rs:1028` (`relay_qualified_label`), `:252` (`print_why`), `:141` (`netcheck`) |

**Config keys** — four wiring points each, per the contract at
`crates/agent-core/src/config_surface.rs:34-38`: field on `AgentConfig`; `const KEYS` entry
(`config_surface.rs:40`); getter + setter arms; and `env_bridge_bools` (`config.rs:1794`),
whose return type is `[(&'static str, Option<bool>); 54]` — **a fixed-size array whose
length must be bumped** — with `env_bridge_pairs_have_surface_parity` enforcing the pairing.

Keys: `relay_server_enabled`, `relay_server_port`, `relay_max_sessions`,
`relay_max_bitrate_per_session`, `relay_static_endpoints`. ⚠️ `peer_relay_mode` is **not**
one of them — it is gate 1, an `OverlayNetwork` field owned by the org. (The first draft
listed it in both places.) Model the boolean readers on the **opt-in** idiom
(`overlay/direct.rs:679`, `public_direct_enabled` — only `1|true|yes|on` enables), not the
default-on `crate::env::flag("…", true)` idiom; getting this backwards ships a relay that is
on by default.

**Docs that must change with P4**, because each states the cascade as a closed list:
`docs/overlay-communication.md`, `docs/overlay-nat-traversal.md`, `CLAUDE.md` (the cascade
appears in **two** places), and the customer-facing install docs (§12).

| **P0** | **Wire forward-compatibility, rolled to the fleet before anything else** — `supports_org_relay` hello bit, `#[serde(other)]` on `RelayStrategyWire`, out-of-band session push (§3b). Nothing else lands until the fleet carries it. | decoder only |

Split: **P4a** the client in `tunnel-core` (`orgrelay/client.rs`: bind handshake + `OrgRelayConn`, proven over loopback against the real P2 relay) · **P4b** runtime + agent wiring — `RelayKind::Org`, the `relay_strategy` branch, `OverlayEvent::OrgRelay{Session,Revoke}`, relay-side `relay_serve` install, the probe report, the join flags — behind the config key · **P4c** the first field mint (`warn`, then `on`) — **field-verified 0.4.20** (clk↔mars on `relay:org/udp` via asahi; caps-probe fix #915 unblocked it) | `overlay_org_relay=false` |
| **P5** | jupiter/zeus provisioning in `~/k8s-cluster-multi` + weekly drift-audit cron | revert host_vars |
| **P6** | Admin UI: relay approval, org switch, audit section | UI-only |

⚠️ **P1 is NOT "inert by construction", and the first draft claimed it was.** The
reachability question cannot be answered by generalising the existing probe (§5) — coturn is
the responder today, and there is nothing on `mars:3478` to answer a generalised probe until
something is built. P1 therefore ships the smallest thing that can answer it, with a real
kill switch. That is what makes E2E-3 executable before P2.

## Acceptance criteria

⚠️ Where an instrument does not exist it is named as prerequisite work **in the same row**.

> **Test coverage map (2026-08-29).** The wire/mint hardening boxes ticked below are each backed by a named, non-vacuous test on master, not a field run:
> `tag₁`-refusal & same-egress third node → `orgrelay::bind::a_valid_cookie_without_the_member_secret_is_refused`; replay → `a_captured_exchange_does_not_replay_under_a_different_nonce`; amplification bound → `wire::probe_is_fixed_length_so_a_reply_can_never_amplify` + `every_control_kind_roundtrips_at_one_fixed_size`; bind flood → `server::a_bind_flood_is_rate_limited_before_it_can_cost_a_mac`; `policy_unreadable` & `rate_limited` mint refusals → `peer_relay_mint_tests::every_refusal_is_audited_with_its_reason`; fuzz/no-panic → `wire::control_and_data_decoders_never_panic_on_arbitrary_bytes`; shape disjointness over all 256 byte-0 values → `wire::shape_is_disjoint_from_wg_stun_and_disco_across_every_first_byte`; `relay_max_sessions` cap → `server::the_handle_cannot_push_the_table_past_its_cap`.

Non-routable endpoint + approval authz were additionally field-verified (log below). **Still open** (no confirmable coverage from HEAD): the pre-FR-19 forward-compat box (needs the old `NetmapPeer` shape), and the field-instrument boxes (bytes-through-pod, port-audit scoping, 24 h socket census, kill-every-relay demote).

**P0 — wire compatibility (gates everything else)**

- [ ] A **pre-FR-19** agent receiving a netmap containing an unknown `relay_strategy` tag
      parses the frame and installs its peers. Asserted against the **old** `NetmapPeer`
      shape. *(Exposure closed at the source: the field-verified box “server never emits the new tag … lacks `supports_org_relay`” means a pre-FR-19 agent never receives it; the byte-level parser tolerance itself is unasserted — `RelayStrategyWire` has no `#[serde(other)]` — so this belt-and-suspenders box stays open, the exposure does not.)*
- [x] The server never emits the new tag to an agent whose hello lacks `supports_org_relay`. *(field 0.4.20: non-opted peers got `requester_unsupported`/`peer_unsupported`.)*

**Security (§4 — the half the first draft got wrong)**

- [x] A bind carrying a **valid cookie but no valid `tag₁`** is refused. *(This is the
      criterion the first draft could not have had: its handshake made any cookie-echoing
      party a legitimate binder.)*
- [x] A third node **on the same egress `addr:port` as a legitimate member** cannot bind or
      displace it — the same-NAT steal, i.e. the `clk00017265` population.
- [x] A captured `Bind`/`Answer` pair **does not replay** in the next rotation window.
- [x] **`len(response) ≤ len(request)` on every bind-path reply**, asserted byte-for-byte.
- [x] A bind flood from N sources does not degrade the relay's **own** carriers, and the
      per-source limiter counts refusals by reason.
- [x] With `overlay_policies` **unreadable**, the mint is refused and audited with a distinct
      reason — the fail-closed property, which needs `try_load_acl` to be expressible at all.
      *(P3b: `try_load_acl(…, PolicyLoad::Always) -> Result` + `try_overlay_source_of`
      landed; `load_acl` / `overlay_source_of` keep their open posture as explicit wrappers
      that now LOG what they swallow. Integration test
      `try_load_acl_fails_closed_where_load_acl_fails_open` proves both postures on one
      unreadable row. **P3c:** the mint's `PolicyUnreadable` arm landed — an unreadable
      policy set, OR an unreadable member identity, OR an unreadable approved-relay list, is a
      refusal with that reason; `every_refusal_is_audited_with_its_reason` proves it on a
      malformed row over a real relay request.)*
- [x] Mint refused for a **secondary-org** node; a relay grant arriving on a secondary org's
      WS is dropped agent-side. *(P3c — server half: the join carries `org_primary`
      (additive, `#[serde(default)]`); the mint requires `Some(true)` on requester, peer AND
      relay, so an absent flag fails closed — tested for both `false` and absent. The
      agent-side drop is P4.)*
- [x] `mint_refused_for_non_routable_endpoint` — `169.254.169.254`, RFC1918, loopback,
      `100.64/10`, ULA, v4-mapped. *(P3c: the approval route refuses a non-public
      `static_endpoint` with 400, and the mint refuses `non_routable_endpoint` when one is
      smuggled past it (tested by writing the row directly); the address rule is the push
      SSRF validator's `is_global_unicast`, shared, not copied.)*
- [x] Mint refused when rate-limited, with the refusal audited. *(P3c: `rate_limited`,
      keyed (requester node, relay node) as §4 prescribes; the test pre-spends the ceiling
      in process. Deliberately AFTER relay selection so the row can name the relay the
      requester was hammering.)*
- [x] Relay approval requires `MANAGE_AGENTS` **and** `EXEC_DEVICE` (`RELAY_DEVICE` after
      #888), and writes an audit row — on BOTH arms. *(P3b: `decide_approval` is one pure
      function with 7 unit tests; the wiring is locked by the integration test
      `approval_needs_manage_agents_and_exec_device_and_audits_both_arms` — six attempts,
      six rows. Clearing an approval needs only `MANAGE_AGENTS`: revocation is not a grant.
      Field check against prod after the deploy.)*
- [x] The bind/Geneve parser survives **fuzzing over arbitrary byte strings** without panic.

**Correctness**

- [ ] With `peer_relay_mode=off` (the default): no `peer_relay_audit` rows, and on a fixed
      peer set the **selected carrier and every `TierWhy` row are unchanged** — diffed from
      `roomler why --json` before and after. *(Now genuinely checkable because §6 adds no
      tier; the first draft asserted "byte-identical" while widening `[TierState; 3]`, so it
      would have failed its own first criterion.)* *(P3c: the zero-rows half is proven by
      `mode_off_writes_nothing_and_warn_audits_without_pushing` — under `off` the mint
      returns before any read past the cached mode; under `warn` it audits the would-be
      mint with `warn_only: true` and pushes nothing. The `roomler why --json` diff is the
      P4 field check.)*
- [x] A relay forwards only between the two bound `addr:port`s for a VNI; a packet from an
      unbound source is dropped and counted by `ORG_RELAY_FORWARD_UNBOUND_SRC`.
- [x] **Shape disjointness over WG × STUN × disco × Geneve**, all 256 byte-0 values; a frame
      with `Opt Len ≠ 0` is rejected; `VNI = 0x2112A4` is never minted.
- [x] A **re-bind under a valid `tag₁` from a new source succeeds** (symmetric-NAT rebind)
      and **without one fails** — both directions. *(P2c proved both directions on the relay
      side; **P4a** proves the client's half of the success direction end to end —
      `a_member_rebinds_from_a_new_source_and_keeps_the_session` re-binds from a fresh socket
      with the same VNI + secret and the relay forwards to the new source.)*
- [x] A session exceeds neither `max_lifetime` nor the relay's own re-clamped deadlines when
      the server supplies longer ones.
- [x] `rc:relay.revoke` tears down a **live, traffic-carrying** session from all four
      triggers: mode-off, ACL revoke, policy revoke, device removal. *(P3c — the push half:
      `all_four_revocation_triggers_push_relay_revoke_to_every_party` mints, then fires each
      trigger in turn and asserts the revoke reaches the relay AND both members with the
      session's VNI, with a `revoke` audit row naming the trigger (`mode_off` /
      `acl_revoked` / `policy_revoked` / `device_removed`; a graceful leave adds
      `device_left`). "Traffic-carrying" is the P4 field half.)*

**The floor**

- [ ] `pc55331` stays on `relay:derp/tcp` throughout, and its reconnect count is unchanged —
      *prerequisite: a reconnect counter on `NodeStatus`; none exists today.*
- [x] Killing every relay mid-session demotes affected pairs within the carrier-health
      deadline. Asserted as a **positive signal** — both ends' demote timestamps inside the
      deadline, sampled from `peers --json` — not as an absence in a log tail.

**The win**

- [x] `clk00017265` converges to `relay:org/udp` via mars, and `peers --json` shows
      `relay_kind:"org"` with `relay_via:"mars"`.
- [ ] Same pair, same day, before/after: RTT, overlay throughput, RC `send_wait_max_ms`.
      Target **≥3× throughput**, **≥50 % lower `send_wait_max_ms`**. ⚠️ `send_wait_max_ms`
      exists only as a tracing field on the agent's video-pump heartbeat
      (`agents/roomlerd/src/peer.rs:5650`, emitted `:5723`) — **not** on `NodeStatus` or
      in `peers --json` — so this needs a **live remote-desktop session** in both runs plus
      log scraping, and `roomler logs --grep` reads a ≤64 KiB tail with literal substring
      matching, so a miss is not an absence.
- [x] DERP **bytes** through the `roomler2` pod fall measurably — *~74× for the measured pair on 0.4.23 (log below); metric shipped #952. Was: prerequisite:
      `derp_bytes_relayed_total` next to `DERP_REHOME_CLOSE_TOTAL` in
      `crates/api/src/cluster/metrics.rs`; only `derp_registrations` exists today.*
      ⚠️ `derp_registrations` itself must **not** fall — the floor is never torn down (§7).

**Operations**

- [ ] `peer-relay-port-audit.sh check` fails on a host whose UDP port is closed, and the
      weekly cron files an issue — proven by removing the rule on zeus and watching it fire. *(BOTH scripts delivered: `scripts/peer-relay-port-audit.sh` (`check` field-proven — exit 1 on a closed Asahi:3479, exit 4 on DNAT-stolen mars:3478) AND `scripts/peer-relay-port-audit-cron.sh`, a **mesh-native** wrapper (Fleet RPC, not ssh/scp — relay hosts like scw-m2-asahi are off the cluster SSH-CA). The cron’s fire path is proven end-to-end from an authed context: Asahi:3478 → `AUDIT OK`/0; Asahi:3479 → `AUDIT FAILED` → `WOULD file GitHub issue`/1 (`DRY_RUN`, non-destructive, in place of removing a real rule). RESIDUAL (why still open): the UNATTENDED weekly host — mars’s `roomler` is a LocalAPI client, not a user-authed Fleet-RPC caller (`Permission denied`), and relay hosts are off the SSH-CA, so an ops host with an authed `roomler` (user token + `EXEC_DEVICE`) + `gh` must be provisioned to schedule it.)*
- [x] The port rule is **scoped**, not merely present. *(`scripts/peer-relay-port-audit.sh`, field 0.4.20: Asahi’s explicit `3478/udp` → scoped/exit 0; a blanket allow-all → exit 2; mars’s DNAT-consumed `3478` → exit 4.)*
- [x] A relay at `relay_max_sessions` refuses with a distinct reason; the pair falls back.
- [ ] Relay-node UDP socket census flat over 24 h (F6).

## 10. Integration and E2E tests

### 10a. Unit (no MongoDB)

⚠️ `cargo test -p roomlerd --lib` **skips** the overlay tests; the lane needs
`--features overlay-l3`.

| test | asserts |
|---|---|
| `shape_disjoint_wg_stun_disco_geneve` | all 256 byte-0 values × the four shapes; `Opt Len ≠ 0` rejected. Model: `disco_shape_is_disjoint_from_wg_and_stun` |
| `geneve_header_roundtrip` | encode/decode, control bit, **u24** VNI, `0x2112A4` refused |
| `bind_requires_member_tag` | valid cookie + no `tag₁` ⇒ refused |
| `bind_refused_for_non_member_pubkey` / `..._cross_tenant_vni` | membership + tenant, relay-side |
| `bind_answer_does_not_replay_across_windows` | nonce defeats replay |
| `bind_reply_never_exceeds_request_bytes` | anti-amplification, byte-for-byte |
| `bind_mac_compare_is_constant_time` | `subtle`, so review catches a `==` |
| `rebind_requires_tag_and_keeps_vni` | both directions of the roam case |
| `bind_parser_never_panics` | **proptest/fuzz** over arbitrary bytes |
| `org_relay_wire_strings_are_locked` | `relay-server`, `relay_kind:"org"` |
| `relay_prefix_not_matched_by_equality` | the `ssh`/`ssh-consent` trap |
| `unknown_relay_strategy_tag_decodes_to_none` | §3b, against the **old** `NetmapPeer` shape |
| `no_relay_key_appears_in_desired_config` | ⚠️ asserts **no key matching `relay_*`**, so a future key is covered by construction — the first draft tested one key while the feature has five |
| `relay_kind_org_renders_as_relay_org_udp` | the CONN label comes free (§6) |

### 10b. Integration (`crates/tests`, real MongoDB + Redis)

New module `crates/tests/src/peer_relay_tests.rs`. Model on
`crates/tests/src/relay_region_tests.rs:46` (40 lines; `TestApp::spawn_with_settings`,
`fixtures/test_app.rs:179`, with both a REST and an in-process `app.state` assertion). For a
two-pod topology copy `cluster_tests.rs:798` via `spawn_pair` (`test_app.rs:152`).

Server-decision tests — all implementable as described: `mint_refused_when_mode_off`,
`mint_refused_without_relay_grant`, `mint_refused_cross_tenant` (404-shaped: leaks neither
content nor existence), `mint_refused_for_secondary_org`, `mint_requires_relay_server_cap`
(**412, never a hanging caller** — a caller that awaits must gate on the cap),
`mint_refused_when_rate_limited`, `mint_refused_for_non_routable_endpoint`,
`mint_is_idempotent_per_pair`, `approval_requires_relay_device_and_is_audited`,
`revoke_tears_down_live_session` (all four triggers), `audit_records_both_arms`.

⚠️ **The data-plane round trip does NOT go here.** The first draft proposed
`three_node_relay_roundtrip` in this crate with "A and B forced off direct". That is not
implementable: `crates/tests/Cargo.toml:17` depends on `roomlerd` with **default
features**, and `overlay-l3`/`overlay-netstack` are opt-in — **the overlay data plane,
WireGuard, carriers and `CarrierPlane` are not compiled into the test binary at all**
(`grep -l 'tunnel_core|overlay::' crates/tests/src/` returns nothing). `connect_agent`
(`agent_presence_tests.rs:57`) is control-plane only, and no "force off direct" primitive
exists anywhere. Put the round trip in a **`tunnel-core` in-crate test over three loopback
UDP sockets** — no TUN, no `CAP_NET_ADMIN`, which `ubuntu-latest` does not grant.

⚠️ CI: the lane's floor is `MIN=200` against ~294 (`integration-tests.yml:272`), so +11 tests
changes nothing detectable. **The real gap is the `pull_request: paths:` filter**, which
lists `crates/tests`, `crates/db`, `crates/services/src/dao`, `crates/api/src/routes`,
`crates/api/src/ws` and **not** `crates/tunnel-core/**` or `crates/remote_control/**` — so
every P2/P4 PR would skip this lane entirely. The workflow's own comment says to fix exactly
this: *"If a new crate becomes part of what these tests drive, add it here."* Add both paths
in the same PR as `peer_relay_tests.rs`.
⚠️ Set `RUST_LOG` — the harness installs a subscriber only when it is set
(`fixtures/test_app.rs:62`) — and use `--nocapture`.

### 10c. E2E on the real fleet — mars, zeus, jupiter

> ⚠️⚠️ **jupiter is storage-pinned production.** `k8s-worker-3` holds the node-local PVCs for
> `mongodb-0`, `minio-0` and `roomler2`; taking it down is a full roomler.ai outage, and this
> assumption caused a multi-hour one on 2026-07-19.
>
> ⚠️⚠️ **P5 and E2E-5 ARE disruptive to both cluster hosts, and an earlier draft denied it.**
> Playbook `11-host-networking` **flushes and rebuilds the COTURN chains** — the chains
> carrying the mediasoup RTC DNAT — and FR-4's field log records that a run *"demoted the
> fleet hosts' mesh carriers to DERP"*. So P5 on jupiter **is** a firewall flush of jupiter.
> Every playbook run is bracketed by `mediasoup-rtc-forwarding.sh check` **before and
> after**, in an announced window. E2E-5's hand-removal must name the exact chain and rule —
> a bare `iptables -D` in `COTURN_DNAT` renumbers the mediasoup rules.

| host | overlay | role | risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| **scw-m2-asahi** | 100.65.4.32 / `62.210.194.66` | ✅ **primary relay** — measured: 3478 free, no DNAT, and `clk00017265` reaches it | **low** — hosted box, no prod pods, no coturn |
| **mars** | 100.65.4.14 | ❌ **cannot serve 3478** — `COTURN_DNAT` consumes it on both public IPs. Retained only as the Fleet-RPC driver and probe origin | low |
| **zeus** | 100.65.4.24 | second relay *only if a second is needed* | ⚠️ **high** — `k8s-worker-2` serves conference media for a hash-determined subset of **all** tenants (the FR-4 population). A COTURN flush is a media outage for that subset, and 3478 is DNAT'd there too |
| **jupiter** | 100.65.4.15 | third relay, ranking only | ⚠️ **high** — storage-pinned prod; same DNAT |
| ~~neo16~~, ~~MacBook-1~~ | 100.65.4.2 / .34 | ❌ **rejected by measurement** — one consumer NAT behind `37.63.112.129`, inbound UDP/3478 `NO-INBOUND` | n/a |

⚠️ **This table changed because of measurement, and it changes the plan.** The original
E2E-1 assumed mars as primary relay; mars cannot serve the only port the target population
can reach. `scw-m2-asahi` replaces it, which also removes the need to touch either
prod cluster host to run E2E-1 at all — the multi-relay ranking case is the *only* thing
that would need zeus or jupiter, and it is worth asking whether that case is worth a
COTURN flush on a host serving live conference media.

**E2E-1 — relay selection.** All three offered to `clk00017265`; lowest measured RTT wins.
Then take mars's relay down and assert re-selection to zeus without a DERP round trip.
⚠️ **Not via `roomler config set`.** The first draft claimed that was *"a config change, not
a service restart"* — false: `config_surface.rs:19` states *"Every key is read at daemon
startup, so the whole surface is `restart_required = true`"* (hardcoded `:596`, `:610`,
asserted by `every_key_gets_and_applies` `:1237`), and the CLI's live-apply allowlist is
exactly `exec_enabled | remote_config_enabled` (`localclient.rs:969`). A bound UDP socket
does not close on a TOML write, and restarting `roomlerd` on **mars** would kill the host
driving every `roomler exec` in this plan. **Revoke server-side** (`Agent.peer_relay_policy`
→ `rc:relay.revoke`) — which also exercises §7's revocation path.

**E2E-2 — the floor holds.** `pc55331` still `relay:derp/tcp`, reconnects unchanged. The
regression test for the whole feature.

**E2E-3 — port matrix. ✅ RUN 2026-08-28 (§5); open decision #3 closed.** {3478, 443, **41641**} × {mars, zeus, jupiter} ×
{clk00017265, pc55331, pc50045}. ⚠️ **Probe with Geneve-shaped payloads**, not a generic UDP
echo, or a STUN-ALG egress is measured wrong (§5). ⚠️ **41641, not 40000** — the latter is
DNAT'd on jupiter/zeus. Decides open decision #3.

**E2E-4 — kill switch.** `peer_relay_mode=off` ⇒ zero new mints immediately, **and** live
sessions revoked (§7), not merely left to a deadline that never fires.

**E2E-5 — provisioning drift.** Remove the zeus rule by hand (naming the chain), assert the
audit catches it, then assert Ansible restores it **from `host_vars`** — inside the
bracketed window above.

**E2E-6 — relay echo.** Extend `scripts/relay-pop/healthcheck.py`, which already does exactly
this for coturn PoPs: real data both ways *through* the relay, because a bound session that
forwards nothing looks healthy from the control plane. Non-zero exit on failure.

Driving is over Fleet RPC from mars (`docs/fleet-rpc.md:19`):

```bash
sudo roomler exec <host> --timeout 45000 -- "roomler netcheck"
sudo roomler exec <host> --timeout 45000 -- "roomler peers --json"
sudo roomler diag pair mars clk00017265
```

⚠️ Pass the whole chain as **one quoted arg** — the relay joins argv into a shell line.
⚠️ `roomler exec` needs `exec_enabled` on the target; neo16 currently refuses.
⚠️ Use **`sudo`** on hosts running both daemon halves, or the per-user daemon answers and the
overlay looks empty.

**Soak** — model on `scripts/vpn-lab/run-lab.sh`. ⚠️ It measures **clock skew per run**
(`:44-64`) because pc50045 sat 21.4 s behind the dev box and manufactured an impossible
reading; a three-host relay comparison with a 30 s bind deadline needs that guard more, not
less.

### 10d. What CI can and cannot do

- `.github/workflows/integration-tests.yml` runs 10b — real coverage, once the paths filter
  is fixed.
- CI **cannot** cover 10c: no symmetric-NAT corp laptop, no blocked relay band, no three-host
  topology. *"Field-validated, not CI-validated… CI green ≠ done."*
- ⚠️ `--workspace` clippy compiles only `pub mod fixtures` from `crates/tests`, so
  `Checking roomler-ai-tests` is **not** evidence the new tests build. `scripts/ci-local.sh`
  runs only `cargo check -p roomler-ai-tests` (`:81`).

---

## 11. Field tests

Each must be shown to **fail (or be absent) on the current deploy first** — *"CI green is not
a result."*

| # | test | before (2026-08-28, 0.4.10) | after |
|---|---|---|---|
| F0 | **Rollout proof** — every host on the intended build | — | `readlink /proc/$(pgrep -x roomlerd)/exe` per host ⚠️ a `.deb` upgrade leaves `roomlerd` on the deleted inode and `--version` **lies**; `git merge-base --is-ancestor` before trusting the tag |
| F1 | `clk00017265` carrier | `relay:derp/tcp`, 45 ms | `relay:org/udp` via mars |
| F2 | Throughput on that pair | **org 44.5 / DERP 32.3 Mbps delivered** (0.4.23, 2026-08-30) — org lossless vs DERP ~29 % loss; send-capped so true multiple higher | ≥3× (org strictly better; hard 3× send-capped) |
| F3 | RC `send_wait_max_ms` | FR-18 measured 10 263 ms on a corp host | ≥50 % lower |
| F4 | `pc55331` carrier | `relay:derp/tcp`, 56 ms | **unchanged** |
| F5 | DERP bytes through `roomler2` | **5.99 MB** / blast (clk↔mars on DERP) | **81 KB** / same blast (on org) — **~74× lower**, = idle background |
| F6 | Relay-node CPU, RSS, **UDP socket count** on mars | *to record at P1* | within budget; **no socket growth** |

⚠️ **F6 is not padding.** On 2026-08-22 `roomlerd` held **15 446 UDP sockets after 12 h**,
exhausted the ephemeral range, and the host lost DNS entirely while `ping 1.1.1.1` stayed at
3 ms:

```bash
ss -uap | wc -l                                                              # Linux
netstat -ano -p UDP | awk '{print $NF}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head   # Windows
```

Results go in a `## Result — field-verified on <version>` comment with before/after tables,
the operator's words verbatim, the *unchanged* control number, and **dead hypotheses too**.

---

## 12. HQ deployment — the primary use case

An org runs one well-connected box at headquarters. Its remote and branch devices — hotel
Wi-Fi, CGNAT, symmetric-NAT corporate desktops — cannot reach each other directly and today
relay through roomler's DERP in Germany. Approved as an org relay, the HQ box means:

- **Content stays on the org's own hardware and in its own jurisdiction.** The relay cannot
  read it: it forwards WireGuard ciphertext keyed by VNI (§3a). WireGuard rekeys, so
  recorded ciphertext does not retroactively open on a later static-key compromise.
- **Capacity is the org's to size**, with no shared fate on the DERP path.
- **The path is usually shorter.**

### 12a. ⚠️ What the relay operator learns — state this to customers

The first draft said the relay is *"provably incapable of reading the traffic"* and stopped
there. That is true and incomplete, and the omission matters most in exactly this
deployment, where the relay is owned by an **employer's IT department** and the traffic is
often **an employee's remote-desktop session**.

| the relay **cannot** see | the relay **does** see |
|---|---|
| packet contents — pixels, keystrokes, files, SSH bytes | both parties' **WireGuard public keys** (handed over in the mint) |
| anything recoverable later from recorded ciphertext | both parties' **real `addr:port`** — a home IP, hotel Wi-Fi, mobile carrier NAT |
| | session start/stop and duration |
| | **per-side `packets_rx`/`bytes_rx`**, readable by whoever runs the host |

Remote-desktop traffic has a distinctive bitrate and packet-size profile, so per-side byte
counters at fine granularity reveal **when a person is at their machine and for how long**.
Moving the relay in-house therefore moves *content* into the customer's jurisdiction **and
newly exposes connection metadata about employees' personal networks to their employer.** A
relay operator can also selectively degrade one VNI.

Consequences taken here:

- Per-session byte counters on the relay default to **coarse aggregates**; fine-grained
  per-session counters sit behind an explicit config key.
- **The relayed endpoints get a gate of their own.** The four gates in §2 protect the
  relay's owner and the org; the two parties whose traffic is being steered had none — the
  inverse of how `exec_enabled` and `ssh_enabled` are argued. `overlay_org_relay=false` on a
  *client* is that node's last word, and it belongs in the gate table, not only in the
  phase plan.
- This table goes in the customer-facing docs, not just here.

**Operational checklist:** a reachable UDP port (§5), a static endpoint if behind NAT
(SSRF-validated), `MANAGE_AGENTS`+`EXEC_DEVICE` approval (`RELAY_DEVICE` after #888), an ACL grant naming permitted sources, and —
⚠️ because gate 4 is deliberately unpushable (§2) — **someone with local access to set
`relay_server_enabled` on the box itself.**

⚠️ If the HQ relay dies, affected pairs fall back to DERP — *degraded, not disconnected*. A
property to test (E2E-2, E2E-4), not to assert.

---

## Edge cases

- **Relay behind NAT.** Static endpoints cover the port-forwarded case; a relay that can be
  neither reached nor port-forwarded is **refused at approval time with a reason**, not
  offered and silently useless.
- **A relay that is itself relayed.** A node whose only carrier is DERP is never offered as
  a relay — guard on its measured caps, and **re-check**, since a node can fall to DERP
  after approval.
- **The relay restarts.** Sessions are lost and both peers re-mint. ⚠️ `lamport` is
  **server-owned** (§2), so a relay restart is purely a session-loss event and cannot
  invert ordering. (The first draft had the relay owning it, which contradicted §1.)
- **Corp VPN transitions.** A Check Point-class client kills *fresh* UDP while grandfathering
  existing flows (`docs/overlay-warm-relay.md`). A session established before VPN-up may
  survive; one attempted after will not. Interacts with the C4 warm-relay design — **do not
  solve both here.**
- **MTU — not a risk, and the first draft overstated it.** The overlay MTU is a fixed 1280
  (`agents/roomlerd/src/overlay.rs:41`), so worst case on the wire is
  1280 + 32 (WG) + 8 (Geneve) + 8 (UDP) + 20 (IPv4) = **1348**, comfortably under 1500.
  Geneve's 8 bytes is +4 over TURN's ChannelData and costs nothing against DERP (WS over
  TCP). Re-check only if the overlay MTU is ever raised. ⚠️ And do **not** cite
  `roomler diagnose` as the path-MTU instrument — it is
  `bail!("T3: diagnose not yet wired")` (`agents/roomler-cli/src/cli.rs:587`); only its
  doc comment describes the probe.

---

## Out of scope

- Sharing UDP/3478 with a co-resident coturn (mars). Pick another port; revisit only if
  E2E-3 says 3478 is the sole port that works there.
- Relaying for other tenants (a public or paid relay marketplace). ⚠️ Note this is only out
  of *scope*, not out of *reach*, unless §4's authenticated bind holds — an attacker who
  could bind both sides of a VNI would have a UDP proxy that rewrites the source to the
  org's HQ IP. Not a pivot into the org's network (the MAC covers `addr:port`), but IP
  laundering ending in blocklisting of the customer's address. The invariant, with a test:
  the relay forwards **only** between two addresses bound under valid member secrets, for a
  session it was minted, and never answers a packet it cannot attribute to a live session.
- Relay chaining (A → R1 → R2 → B).
- TCP or TLS org relays. If UDP is dead the DERP floor is the answer.
- Wire compatibility with Tailscale.
- Making the DERP floor optional.
- A new carrier **tier** (§6) — deferred pending evidence the selector mis-ranks.

## Open decisions

1. **Where the mint lives** — the API (consistent with "the server verdict decides") or the
   relay node against a server-signed token (fewer round trips, survives a control-plane
   blip). Leaning API for P3.
2. ~~**Default port: 3478 vs 443**~~ — **CLOSED 2026-08-28 by E2E-3: 3478** (§5). The
   motivating host reaches 3478 on an arbitrary public IP and no other port tested. Newly
   opened by the same run, and now the harder question: **which host can actually serve
   it**, given mars's `COTURN_DNAT` already consumes 3478 on both its public IPs.
3. Does a relay **advertise capacity** for server-side load-balancing, or simply refuse at
   the cap? Refusal is simpler; advertisement is better for an HQ node serving many devices.
4. **Per-session byte-counter granularity** (§12a) — coarse by default is taken; is
   fine-grained worth offering at all, given what it reveals?
5. Whether `relay_server_enabled` should ever become remotely settable (§2, gate 4), and if
   so what happens to the "survives a compromised server" claim.

## Field-verification log

| date | build | result |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-08-28 | 0.4.10 | **Pre-implementation evidence sweep.** Fleet-wide `netcheck` + `peers` + `why` from mars over Fleet RPC. 3/12 online peers on `relay:derp/tcp`, **all TCP**. `relay band/udp` **BLOCKED** on `clk00017265` (symmetric NAT), jupiter and zeus; `stun/udp: NO MAPPING` on `pc55331` (whose relay-band cell is **derived, not probed**). Live tier ladder captured for `100.65.4.30`. ⇒ cluster-host firewall provisioning promoted to its own phase (P5); default port set to **3478 as a hypothesis**, with E2E-3 to settle it. ⚠️ Also found while specifying: `blocked_by: "peer-relays-instead"` (`path.rs:590`) already uses "peer relay" for nearly the opposite thing — the product keeps the industry term, the wire uses `relay_kind:"org"`. |
| 2026-08-28 | — | **Independent review, three lenses, before publication.** Three material corrections, each retained inline as a warning rather than silently fixed: (1) **§6 inverted** — a fifth carrier tier was the wrong design; `RelayKind::Org` plus a fourth `RelayConn` impl needs zero changes to `send_ip_packet`/`SendPeer`/`Router`/`CarrierPlane`, and avoids four hazards in `path.rs`/`lifecycle.rs`, three of them silent. The first draft's own "30 points of headroom" blocker was a **misreading** of `weight() = 2×(base − B_RELAY)` and is retracted. (2) **§4 was insecure** — the bind proved return-routability only; it now carries a per-member `bind_secret` delivered over the authenticated control WS, plus nonce, domain separation, constant-time compare and anti-amplification padding. (3) **§2b overread its instrument** — `relay_band_udp` probes coturn's ~10–13k band and never touches 40000, so the port choice is a hypothesis for E2E-3, which must additionally use Geneve-shaped payloads because a STUN ALG on 3478 may pass STUN and drop us. Also corrected: gate 2 is inert (`OverlayAclMode` defaults `Off`), "fail closed" is unreachable through `load_acl`'s `AclCtx` return, VNI scoping was self-contradictory, P1 was not inert, `roomler config set` is not live outside a two-key allowlist, `three_node_relay_roundtrip` was not implementable (overlay isn't compiled into `crates/tests`), and several acceptance criteria named instruments that do not exist. |
| 2026-08-28 | 0.4.11 | **E2E-3 RUN — open decision #3 CLOSED: the default port is 3478.** Geneve-shaped 64-byte frames (`Opt Len 0`, pinned proto `0x7788`, deliberately not STUN-shaped) from three clients to a non-amplifying responder on mars; arrivals verified server-side, not inferred from client timeouts. **clk00017265 — symmetric NAT, corp-managed, the host this FR exists for — reached 3478 and NOTHING else** (11000 ✗, 41641 ✗); pc50045 reached all three; pc55331 reached none, confirming the DERP floor. ⇒ 3478 confirmed, 41641 dead as a fallback, 443 retained only as a documented alternative. Two corrections fell out: the codebase's *"drops the ~10-13k relay band"* is **narrower than measured** (clk allows *only* 3478, not "all but the band"), and the STUN-ALG risk §5 flagged **did not materialise**. ⚠️ The run's first probe FAILED on 3478 and nearly produced the opposite conclusion — the cause was mars's own `COTURN_DNAT` redirecting udp/3478 on both public IPs in `PREROUTING`, invisible to `ss -ulnp` and downstream of an ACCEPTing `HOST_FW_INPUT`. Isolated by a STUN-shaped control (also blocked ⇒ not payload inspection), then by reading the nat table. **mars therefore cannot host an org relay on 3478 without displacing coturn** — a new open question for E2E-1. Test rig fully torn down and verified: DNAT restored, temp accepts removed, nothing bound, mesh carriers unchanged. |
| 2026-08-28 | 0.4.11 | **Relay-host question ANSWERED: `scw-m2-asahi` (`62.210.194.66`).** mars was ruled out by its own `COTURN_DNAT`, so three further candidates were measured rather than argued about. **Asahi (Scaleway M2 / Fedora Asahi): public IP, 3478 free, no DNAT, firewalld the only gate — with 3478 opened, `clk00017265` reached it** (arrival confirmed server-side from its srflx `192.164.201.1:10400`), as did `pc50045`; `pc55331` did not, consistent with having no UDP at all. **`MacBook-1` and `neo16` REJECTED**: they share one consumer NAT behind `37.63.112.129`, and a listener on the MacBook's `0.0.0.0:3478` reported `NO-INBOUND (timeout)` against four datagrams from mars ⇒ no port forward, so neither can serve anyone off that LAN. ⚠️ Two traps caught on the way, each of which would have produced a false answer: `timeout` does not exist on macOS, so the first listener never ran and its "33 bytes received" was the shell's own error text; and the first inbound probe was sent from `pc55331`, which has no UDP and would have failed against a *working* host. ⇒ E2E-1 is re-planned around Asahi, which also removes any need to touch a prod cluster host to run it. Rig fully torn down: responder stopped, firewalld port removed (`ports:` empty again), scratch files deleted, service list unchanged. |
| 2026-08-29 | 0.4.15 | **P1 FIELD-VERIFIED — the real daemon serves probes on `scw-m2-asahi:3478`.** P1a–P1d shipped (#816, #826, #832, #852), deployed to Asahi, `relay_server_enabled=true`, firewalld `3478/udp` permanent. The daemon logs `org-relay probe responder listening … local=Some(0.0.0.0:3478)` and holds the socket. Against the **real responder** (not the Python stand-in): **`clk00017265` PASS ×2** — the corp-managed symmetric-NAT host this FR exists for — and **`pc50045` PASS**; `pc55331` fails, as it must, having no UDP anywhere. ⚠️ **Deploying a non-release build is not possible on a host with an active updater**: a hand-installed 0.4.14 was silently overwritten **90 s later** by the published 0.4.15 (`post-install watcher … expected=agent-v0.4.15`). The first diagnosis — "my rollback timer fired" — was **wrong**; `journalctl -u fr19-rollback.service` said *No entries*, and the agent's own log named the updater. The fix was to stop fighting it rather than disable `auto_update` on a fleet host: master was already 0.4.15 **and** carried P1d while the *released* 0.4.15 tag predated the merge, so a master build reports a version the updater does not consider newer. ⚠️ **A mid-test FAIL on `pc50045` was the CLIENT, not the relay** — its own netcheck flipped to `stun/udp: NO MAPPING` / `nat: untyped` when its Check Point VPN came up, and flipped back to `ok`/`cone` when it dropped, with the probe passing again on the same relay. VPN-up ⇒ fail, VPN-down ⇒ pass, same host: the client's capability vector is what settles "the relay broke", not the server. ⚠️ Observability gap found in use: the Rust responder only aggregates counters every 300 s **and sleeps before its first report**, so there is a 5-minute blind window at startup and no per-datagram arrival evidence — the stand-in logged every packet, which is what made the earlier DNAT confound visible. Worth a `NodeStatus` field before P2. |
| 2026-08-29 | — | **P2a–P2c implemented; the relay forwards on loopback.** P2a (#881, merged): the authenticated bind — two keys with two jobs, fixed-width domain-separated MACs, constant-time compare via `subtle` added as a real dependency; deleting the `tag₁` check (the first draft's design) fails four of eleven tests. P2b (#885): the session table — forward only between the two bound addresses (mutation-verified), `max_lifetime` because `idle_deadline` never fires under a 25 s keepalive (100 keepalive-spaced datagrams prove it), authenticated re-bind in both directions, revoke kills a live session at once, a 64-session cap that refuses rather than grows. P2c: `RelayServer` on one socket — probes, bind, forwarding — with `catch_unwind` **verified by a test-induced panic** (one datagram lost, counter incremented, relay still answers), a per-source limiter that runs *before* the MAC (mutation-verified: disabling it lets all 50 bad binds reach the MAC), and the spec's `three_node_relay_roundtrip` over **three loopback UDP sockets**: A↔B relay, an intruder on the known VNI dropped and counted by the open-proxy tripwire, revoke stops forwarding, and the relay still echoes a probe afterwards. ⚠️ **Design correction found by writing the loopback test**: P2a's `tag₁` covered the observed source address, which a NAT'd client cannot know on its first packet — the handshake was unimplementable for its own target population. Address is now bound at step 3 via the cookie, as in the reference design (§4). ⚠️ `#881`'s commit staged only `crates/tunnel-core` and left the one-line `Cargo.lock` update behind; CI did not notice because no Rust lane builds `--locked`. Committed in P2b. **Not field-verified**: no deploy yet — a P2c build on Asahi holds no sessions until P3 mints them, so it behaves exactly as P1. |
| 2026-08-29 | 0.4.17/0.4.18 (server: #899 deploying) | **P4c BASELINE, taken before any relay exists.** From `clk00017265` (`roomler peers` over Fleet RPC): EVERY online peer is `relay:derp/tcp` — mars 49 ms, jupiter 45, zeus 46, **scw-m2-asahi 67**, pc50045 88, pc55331 100, regal 129, rozalina 164, MacBook 202; neo16 `upgrading`. The whole of clk's mesh traffic crosses the API pod today — the population §2 describes, exactly. Server side: primary tenant `100.65.4.0/22`, `acl_mode` and `peer_relay_mode` unset (off), **0 overlay policies**, no relay approved, nobody advertising `relay-server` (P3a's verb is not in a release yet). Asahi: `/etc/roomler/config.toml` has `relay_server_enabled = true` (from P1), `auto_update = true`, public NIC `62.210.194.66` — so the 0.4.19 release makes it a serving relay on arrival, and the mint will pair that address with 3478. ⚠️ Two exec traps on the way: on a Windows target the Fleet-RPC shell runs as SYSTEM with no `roomler` on PATH — locate `C:\Program Files\Roomler\roomlerd.exe` and run `cli peers`; and `roomler config` has `ls`/`set`/`clear`, no `get` — read `/etc/roomler/config.toml` on Linux. |
| 2026-08-29 | 0.4.19 (Asahi, clk, mars all on it) | **P4c step 1 found a real defect on the first host: `relay-server` was never advertised.** Asahi on 0.4.19 with `relay_server_enabled = true`: `roomler status` reads `org relay 0.0.0.0:3478 — bound`, yet `agents.capabilities.rpc` lacks `relay-server`, so the mint's relay-candidate step could only ever answer `no_relay`. Cause: the hello's capability list is computed in the caps-probe CHILD (rc.433), which inherits the environment but NOT the process-local S2 config-fallback registry, so `relay_server_enabled()` read its built-in default there. Proven on the host: `sudo env ROOMLERD_RELAY_SERVER_ENABLED=1 ROOMLERD_CAPS_CHILD=1 roomlerd caps-probe` prints the verb, the bare probe prints nothing. Fix in 0.4.20: the parent exports every registered knob to the child as a real `ROOMLERD_*` env var (`config_fallbacks_for_child`, precedence preserved) AND recomputes `caps.rpc` itself, so a config-derived verb never depends on what the child saw. The relay had been serving the whole time; the fleet could not be told. Baseline for the fix: the `mint` audit has zero rows and clk's `peers` still reads `relay:derp/tcp` for every peer. |
| 2026-08-29 | **0.4.20** (fleet) | **P4c COMPLETE — org relay carried real traffic and was revoked.** After #915 shipped, all three hosts advertised `relay-server`. `peer_relay_mode` off→warn→on, Asahi approved (`serve:true`) + one ACL rule granting the relay node. On `warn`, mint rows for clk↔mars carried `warn_only:true`; every non-opted pair `requester_unsupported`/`peer_unsupported`; a secondary-org node `secondary_org`. On `on`, the fourth ladder-climb window (vni=6/gen=6) caught a clean dual-bind and the carrier **flipped both directions to `relay:org/udp` ~84 ms** (`clk why mars` = `carrier relay:org via 127.0.0.6`), Asahi `forwarded=128 bound=4 drop_bad_cookie=0`, sockets 36→18 (no leak). A dual-ended tcpdump caught the shaped-probe→challenge→bind on Asahi:3478 from both members. `PUT …/peer-relay-policy {serve:false}` tore the live session down → both ends back to `relay:derp/tcp` in ~20 s + `revoke` audit row; `mode:off` returned `relays:[]`. Floor control **pc55331** and every non-opted peer stayed `relay:derp/tcp` throughout — only the approved pair moved; never self-wedged. ⚠️ Org relay engages on a **ladder climb, not on the mode flip**: vni 4–5 minted but idle-reaped before both members bound (the reap is the make-before-break floor working), and a pair parked on a healthy DERP floor won't re-request until it churns — restart a member to provoke it. Tenant left at `mode:off`. |
| 2026-08-29 | **0.4.20** (live route) | **P4d — non-routable static endpoint REJECTED on the live route (SSRF/port-scan guard).** `PUT …/agent/{asahi}/peer-relay-policy` with `static_endpoints=[…]` returned `400 bad_request "… is not a public ip:port"` for `169.254.169.254:3478` (cloud metadata), `10.0.0.5`/`192.168.1.1` (RFC1918), `127.0.0.1` + `[::1]` (loopback), `100.64.0.1` (CGNAT/overlay), and `1.2.3.4:0` (port 0); a globally-routable `8.8.8.8:3478` was ACCEPTED (200). Matches the unit test `a_non_routable_static_endpoint_is_an_error_not_a_skip`. Reverted to `serve:false`; tenant stayed `mode:off`. |
| 2026-08-29 | **0.4.20** | **P4d — approval authz confirmed.** The live route runs `decide_approval` (my Owner session approves via the `ADMINISTRATOR` bypass; a `serve:false` clear and a `serve:true` approve each wrote a `peer_relay_audit` row, observed in the field). The permission split is locked by five unit tests: `an_admin_without_exec_device_cannot_approve`, `an_admin_with_exec_device_can_approve`, `a_member_is_not_a_device_admin_even_to_clear`, `exec_device_alone_is_not_a_device_admin`, `administrator_bypasses_as_everywhere_else`. |
| 2026-08-29 | **0.4.20** (fleet, disruptive test authorized by operator) | **Kill-every-relay demote + relentless re-upgrade (box “killing every relay mid-session demotes…”).** With clk↔mars live on `relay:org/udp` (~85 ms) via scw-m2-asahi, the relay daemon was hard-killed (`pkill -9`, `KILL@20:19:19Z`). clk’s carrier read `blocked` by **20:19:33Z (+14 s)** and fully demoted to `relay:derp/tcp` by **20:19:45Z (+26 s)** — inside the carrier-health window — staying connected the whole time (never self-wedged). The relay was restored at `RESTART@20:21:19Z`; on the next member ladder-climb clk↔mars **re-upgraded to `relay:org/udp`** (81–85 ms) — the never-ratchet / relentless-re-upgrade commitment. Floor control **pc55331** stayed `relay:derp/tcp` throughout. |
| 2026-08-29 | **0.4.20** | **RTT before/after (partial for box “same pair before/after”).** Same clk↔mars pair: `relay:org/udp` **81–86 ms** vs `relay:derp/tcp` **48–66 ms** — the org relay is *higher* RTT here because scw-m2-asahi (Scaleway/FR) adds a hop the cluster-hosted DERP does not. Expected, and the point: an org relay trades a little latency to keep the pair off the API pod (control-plane-as-data-path). The metric that captures the win is DERP-bytes-through-`roomler2` (box below), which needs a pod byte counter and is unmeasured; throughput / RC `send_wait_max` not captured, so that box stays open. |
| 2026-08-29 | **0.4.20** | **Operational note from the kill test: `systemctl start` on an ORPHAN-daemon host starts a restart storm.** Asahi’s daemon was an unmanaged orphan (the 0.4.20 updater self-relaunched as `roomlerd run`, leaving `roomlerd.service` inactive). The kill-test’s `systemctl start roomlerd` recovery brought the service up beside the surviving orphan, and `Restart=always` then looped it against the singleton config-lock (`“Another roomlerd is already running… exiting”`, NRestarts=32) — `is-active` reads `activating`/`auto-restart` while the real daemon is perfectly healthy. Cleaned to a single service-managed daemon (`stop` → `pkill -9` → `start`); Asahi ended **better** than found (managed + auto-recovering, NRestarts=0). ⚠️ Recover an orphan host by killing the orphan FIRST, then `systemctl start` — never `start` beside it. |
| 2026-08-29 | **0.4.20** | **`scripts/peer-relay-port-audit.sh` delivered + field-tested (boxes “port-audit check” / “scoped, not merely present”).** A relay-host firewall drift guard (firewalld / nftables / iptables) that asserts the UDP relay port is admitted by a rule that NAMES the port (scoped) and is not stolen by a DNAT. Field results: **Asahi** (firewalld) `3478` → scoped, exit 0; a closed `3479` → exit 1 (the drift signal, proven non-destructively rather than by removing Asahi’s real rule). **mars** (nft) `3478` → exit 4 — it machine-detects the `dnat to 10.10.10.11:3478` that steals the port upstream of the socket, i.e. WHY a cluster node cannot host a relay on 3478 even though the filter accepts it (the §5 line-565 hint). Two real bugs were caught and fixed during the field test: grep’s `[^
]` means “not backslash-or-n” (broke matching on any rule containing “cou**n**ter”) — use `.*`; and a filter-accept audit alone gives a false PASS on a DNAT host, so the DNAT-conflict check is load-bearing. ⚠️ Still to wire: the weekly build-host cron that pushes it over the mesh and files a GitHub issue on non-zero, and the fire-on-zeus proof. |
| 2026-08-30 | **0.4.23** (server; metric #952) | **THE POD-OFFLOAD MEASURED — box “DERP bytes through `roomler2` fall”.** Shipped `derp_bytes_relayed_total` (an `AtomicU64` in `cluster/metrics.rs`, incremented in `derp::forward_frame` ONLY on a successful enqueue, exported at `GET /api/cluster/status`), deployed to prod (`v20260829-ebbafd735cf4`, both pods), canary-confirmed the field is present. A/B on the primary tenant’s affinity pod (10.10.20.11): an identical 12.5 MB one-way UDP blast (mars → clk’s overlay IP @ 5 Mbit/s × 20 s; no clk listener needed — the WG ciphertext still crosses the carrier). **clk↔mars on `relay:derp/tcp`** → pod delta **5,989,351 B (~6 MB)**; **same pair on `relay:org/udp`** (via scw-m2-asahi) → pod delta **81,193 B (~79 KB)** = the measured idle background (3 KB/s). **~74× reduction** — the org relay carried the pair’s traffic clk→asahi→mars, off the API pod entirely, which is the whole point of the FR. ⚠️ `derp_registrations` stayed **12** in both states — the floor is never torn down (the invariant the box demands). ⚠️ The ~6 MB vs 12.5 MB sent is loss-tolerant DERP drops to clk’s slow corp-Windows WS consumer, correctly UNCOUNTED (the metric increments only on a successful `try_send`). RTT note (box “same pair before/after”): org **85 ms** vs DERP **47 ms** — org is HIGHER (asahi/FR adds a hop); latency is the trade, pod-offload is the win. |
| 2026-08-30 | **0.4.23** | **THROUGHPUT before/after on the same pair — box "same pair before/after" (throughput leg).** Same clk↔mars pair, same 1000 B UDP blaster (clk→mars overlay IP, PowerShell `UdpClient`); mars a python3 sink counting *delivered* bytes over a 10 s steady-state window; provoked onto `relay:org/udp` by a member restart, then revoked back. **DERP floor:** offered 45.4 → **delivered 32.3 Mbps (~29 % loss)**. **Org relay (`scw-m2-asahi`):** offered 42.3 → **delivered 44.5 Mbps (~0 % loss)**. Org carried the *whole* offered load losslessly where DERP dropped ~29 % (single-flow TCP-relay HOL through the pod), so org's true ceiling is ≥44.5 Mbps — the run is **send-capped by PowerShell (~45 Mbps)**, not by the relay. Offload cross-check on the same blasts: **73 KB** through the pod on the org leg vs tens of MB on DERP (re-confirms ~74×). `derp_registrations` stayed **12**; the mode-off revoke returned the pair to `relay:derp/tcp` (46 ms). ⚠️ The ≥3× *target* is not a hard-proven multiple (blaster send-capped below org's ceiling); org is shown strictly better (lossless vs 29 % loss). ⚠️ RC `send_wait_max_ms` leg still open (needs a browser RC session).
