# FR-52: Cross-org remote access — an outsider, a device password, and a server that cannot use it

**Issue:** [#1100](https://github.com/gjovanov/roomler-ai/issues/1100) ·
**Status:** in progress — P1 · P2a–c · P3a–d · P4a–d built: an outsider proves the password to a device through the server, from any pod, and opens ONE session bound to that login by MACs over both DTLS fingerprints — decided by the device, proven against the real agent. **No page yet** (P4e) and **in no release build** (P4f) ·
**Owner:** remote-control (pillar 1) + control plane ·
**Anchors verified against master `41425700`** (re-verified after FR-69)

The gap TeamViewer and AnyDesk fill and roomler does not: someone **outside the
organization** views and controls a device, authorised by a password the device
holds — with consent, with an audit trail, and without the server ever being able
to learn or replay that password.

## Goal

A device owner can let a person who is **not a member of the device's org** open a
remote-desktop session against it, by giving them a **connect code** and a
**password**. Both the org and the device can refuse; the device has the last word;
every attempt, including every refusal, is recorded.

Four properties, stated as the acceptance bar rather than as a description:

1. **The server is not the gate.** A compromised or malicious control plane cannot
   open an external session, cannot recover the password, and cannot substitute
   itself for the device. This is the same property `exec_enabled` / `ssh_enabled` /
   `remote_config_enabled` provide, applied where it matters most — an outsider has
   no tenant membership behind them, so the password *is* the whole authorization.
2. **The outside door is harder than the inside one.** An internal controller passes
   org policy → a permission bit → a device allowlist → consent. An external one
   passes org policy → an admin approval → a device opt-in → a cryptographic proof →
   consent. Nothing about this feature may make the internal path more permissive.
3. **Both TeamViewer workflows, one mechanism.** Durable *unattended* access (the
   personal password) and *ad-hoc attended* support (a one-time code the host reads
   out) differ only in the lifetime of the secret and who initiates. They must not
   be two wires.
4. **An empty audit is never mistaken for an empty history.** Refusals are the
   load-bearing rows, as in `ssh_audit`.

## 1. The gap, measured in the code

Every remote-desktop session passes through **one** function:
`resolve_session_authz` — `crates/modules/remote/src/controller.rs:375`. After the
self-control shortcut, the whole of the cross-org story is three lines:

```rust
// crates/modules/remote/src/controller.rs (the membership read)
let perms = state.tenants
    .get_member_permissions(agent.tenant_id, controller_user_id)
    .await
    .unwrap_or(0);            // ← non-member ⇒ Forbidden ⇒ 0
...
// :471
if !permissions::has(perms, permissions::REMOTE_CONTROL) {
    return Err("you don't have permission to control others' devices".to_string());
}
```

There is no other door. The org boundary is not a policy that can be relaxed with a
setting — it is the shape of the only authorization path. `docs/compare/vs-teamviewer.md:63`
already concedes the consequence in public: *"Attended support for a stranger's PC |
**no** — enrolment model | yes, session codes"*.

Two workflows sit behind the request, and they are not the same feature:

| | Unattended access | Ad-hoc attended support |
|---|---|---|
| Their name for it | personal password | QuickSupport |
| Secret | durable, owner-set | one-time, host-generated |
| Who is at the machine | nobody | the person asking for help |
| Initiated by | the outsider | the host |
| Risk | the higher of the two | the lower of the two |
| Consent default | prompt (owner may set auto) | pre-satisfied by the host's own act |

## 2. The constraint that decides the design

`CLAUDE.md` states it for exec, SSH, peer relays and remote config, and the code
enforces it: **the last gate is owned by the device and the server cannot write it.**
`remote_config_enabled` (`crates/agent-core/src/config.rs:138`) is not merely
defaulted-off — it is *structurally absent* from `DesiredConfig`, and
`crates/remote_control/src/models.rs:915` says so in as many words:

> ⚠️ `remote_config_enabled` is deliberately ABSENT and must never be added.

An external-access password is that class of thing, only more so. So:

### 2a. The design that fails

Browser POSTs the password → API compares an Argon2 hash stored on the `agents` row
→ API tells the agent to start the session.

This puts the gate in the server. A compromised server then opens **any** device in
the fleet; a database dump is a fleet-wide credential dump; and the one property
every neighbouring subsystem is built to preserve is inverted precisely where the
caller is a stranger. It must not ship, and it must be named in the spec so that a
later reviewer recognises it as the tempting shortcut rather than the obvious build.

### 2b. The design that holds

The password lives **only on the device**, in `config.toml`, under the same
atomic + fsync + `.prev` + 0600/ACL treatment `ssh_host_key` already gets
(`crates/agent-core/src/config.rs:199`) — and, exactly as with SSH, **if it cannot be
persisted the feature stays off** rather than running on a per-boot secret.
Verification is a handshake the server merely relays.

### 2c. There is no free permission bit

`VIEW_SSH_AUDIT` is `1 << 30` (`crates/db/src/models/role.rs:91`) and `ALL` is
`(1 << 31) - 1` (`:151`); the UI mask is a signed int32 with bit 30 as the ceiling
(#888). A `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_ACCESS` bit **is not available**. Admin approval is
therefore a *compound* of existing bits — `MANAGE_AGENTS` **+** `REMOTE_CONTROL` —
exactly as FR-19 used `MANAGE_AGENTS` + `EXEC_DEVICE`. Clearing an approval needs
only `MANAGE_AGENTS`: revocation is not a grant.

## 2d. Where this lives after FR-69

The modular monolith (FR-69, #1307) landed between this spec and its first
phase, so the FR now spans **two** module crates, split on the line FR-69 draws:

* **`modules/fleet`** owns P1 — the org switch, the per-device approval, the
  connect code on the `agents` row, and the decision log. That is device
  MANAGEMENT, and it is the exact shape of `agent_exec`, which is fleet's.
* **`modules/remote`** will own P4 — the external branch of
  `resolve_session_authz` and the consent path, because `remote` is *what a
  CONTROLLER reaches* (`crates/modules/remote/src/lib.rs`).

That is the same split exec and SSH already have, and it means P1's routes are
mounted by fleet's `Module::routes` and its collections declared in fleet's
`Module::indexes` — never in `crates/db/src/indexes.rs`, per FR-69 rule 7.

## 3. The gate chain

Five gates, each owned by a different party, each default-deny, every decision
audited. The order is load-bearing: an earlier refusal means the later gates are
never consulted, and never leak that they exist.

| # | Gate | Owner | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Org kill-switch | org admin | `TenantSettings.external_rc_enabled`, default `false` — the twin of `remote_exec_enabled` / `remote_ssh_enabled` (`crates/db/src/models/tenant.rs:147`) and deliberately separate from both. Off ⇒ a connect code does not resolve. |
| 2 | Per-device approval | org admin | `Agent.external_access_policy`, shaped on `PeerRelayPolicy` (`crates/remote_control/src/models.rs:2107`): default closed, set by `MANAGE_AGENTS` + `REMOTE_CONTROL`. Carries a **permission ceiling** (an org may allow external *view* without external *input*) and an optional expiry. |
| 3 | Device opt-in | device owner, locally | `external_access_enabled` in the agent's own config, default off, **absent from `DesiredConfig`**. Alongside: `external_consent_mode`, `external_max_permissions`. The refusal that survives a compromised server. |
| 4 | The password proof | device verifies, outsider proves | §4. The substitute for tenant membership, and the only gate the outsider can satisfy by their own action. |
| 5 | Host consent | whoever is at the machine | The existing `ConsentMode` path, resolved from `external_consent_mode` rather than `AccessPolicy.consent_mode` (`:430`), defaulting to `Prompt`. |

Gate 5 needs one wire addition: the prompt must say the controller is **outside the
organization**. `ServerMsg::Request` (`crates/remote_control/src/signaling.rs:1254`)
carries `tenant_name` for the multi-org case, which answers *which* org is asking —
not whether the asker is in one at all. A `controller_scope: external` field is
additive and serde-defaulted, so older agents keep today's prompt text; a device
that cannot say "outside your organization" must therefore not be gate-2 approvable,
which the `RpcCap` check in §5 enforces.

> **As built (P4).** The field is `Request.external: Option<ExternalGrant>`, and it
> carries more than a scope: the `attempt_id` of the login the device must bind the
> session to (§4c). An older agent would take it as an unknown field and serve the
> outsider as an ordinary controller, so the server opens an external session only
> on a device advertising a SECOND verb, `external-session` — `external-access` says
> a build can LOG an outsider in, which is not the same promise
> (`external_access_does_not_imply_external_session`).

## 4. The handshake

The requirement is narrow: the party *brokering* the exchange must not be able to
learn the password, mount an offline attack on it, replay a captured proof, or
impersonate the device in order to harvest it. That is the textbook case for an
**augmented PAKE**.

**Decision: OPAQUE.** `opaque-ke` 4.0 on the agent and **`@serenity-kit/opaque`**
in the browser — which is opaque-ke 4.0 itself compiled to WASM, so the two speak
RFC 9807 by construction rather than by agreement. Ristretto255, TripleDH over
SHA-512, Argon2id. SRP-6a has the same properties on paper and a long history of
implementation footguns (parameter validation, `B = 0`, group choice); the modexp
would also land in the browser bundle.

> ⚠️ **Corrected in P3a (2026-09-24).** This section originally named
> `@cloudflare/opaque-ts`. That library implements **draft v07** with **scrypt** —
> not RFC 9807, not Argon2id — so it cannot log into an opaque-ke 4.x device at all.
> Checked against its repository, not assumed.

### 4-0. The parameters are a wire surface, and they are pinned

The key-stretching function runs on the **client** — on the device at registration
(it plays both halves) and in the outsider's browser at every login. Both must use
byte-identical Argon2id parameters or the right password is refused. They are
pinned in `external_access::PinnedArgon2`, whose `Default` *is* the pinned instance
because opaque-ke falls back to `CS::Ksf::default()` whenever a caller omits the KSF:

| Parameter | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| algorithm / version | Argon2id / 0x13 | RFC 9106 |
| memory | 2^16 KiB (64 MiB) | the browser library's **default** ("memory-constrained", RFC 9106 §4) — the connect page passes no option, so there is no second copy to drift |
| passes / lanes | 3 / 4 | same preset |
| salt | 16 zero bytes | opaque-ke's convention; OPAQUE salts through the OPRF |

⚠️ **Measured, not argued.** P2b had used `argon2::Argon2::default()` (19 MiB, 2
passes, 1 lane). The real browser client, typing the **correct** password, could not
log into a device registered that way — `KE2 did not verify`. After pinning, the
same client logged in and both sides derived the same session key. A known-answer
test computed by an *independent* Argon2id (OpenSSL, via Node 24) locks the bytes.
The Argon2 is also `opaque_ke::argon2` now, not the workspace crate the server
hashes user passwords with, so a workspace bump cannot move a device's record.

| # | Outsider's browser | Server | Device |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | connect code + password | resolves code → agent; gates 1 + 2, quota, rate limit | — |
| 2 | sends `KE1` (blinded) | relays; learns nothing | gate 3; loads its OPAQUE record |
| 3 | — | relays; learns nothing | replies `KE2` |
| 4 | derives `K`; **verifies the device**; sends `KE3` | relays; learns nothing | derives `K`, verifies `KE3`, grants or refuses, **counts the failure locally** |
| 5 | puts `MAC(K, dtls_fingerprint)` on its SDP offer | forwards the offer as today | **refuses an offer whose fingerprint is not authenticated under `K`** |
| 6 | — | normal consent + session flow | gate 5 |

**Step 5 is the step that earns the claim.** Without it the server is still in the
middle of the media path and "the device verified the password" buys less than it
sounds like. With it, an authenticated session key is bound to the actual DTLS
transport, and a substituted peer fails closed.

**Registration is local and one-directional.** The owner sets the password on the
machine — `roomler rc password set`, or the desktop companion — and the device
computes and stores the OPAQUE record itself. The dashboard may show *set / not set*
and may **clear**; it can never **set**, because a password typed into a web form has
already crossed the server, which is the one thing this design exists to prevent.
(The same asymmetry as gate 2's clear-vs-approve, and for the same reason.)

### 4a. The weaker alternative, and why it is named rather than chosen

Argon2id in the browser plus `HMAC(K, nonce)` is far better than §2a and much less
work. It fails on two counts: the device must then store a **password-equivalent**
secret, and the relaying server gets an **offline cracking oracle** — guess a
password, derive, compute the tag over the nonce *it* chose, compare with the tag it
observed. Against a human-chosen password that is a real break, by exactly the party
this design excludes. It also gives the client no way to authenticate the device.

If it is ever shipped as a stopgap, the wire must carry `extauth_v` from the first
commit: retrofitting a PAKE afterwards means a forced password reset on every device
in the field.

### 4b. Failure counting belongs on the device

The backoff and lockout that make a 4-word password survivable are gate-4 state, so
they live where gate 4 lives. A server-side counter does not survive the threat this
gate exists for. Server-side per-(principal, code) ceilings ride
`crates/api/src/rate_limit.rs:52` as a *second* limit, not the only one.

⚠️⚠️ **A guess is counted when KE1 is ANSWERED — never when KE3 fails.** In OPAQUE
the *client* learns whether its password is right while opening KE2, before a KE3
exists. A guessing client stops there, so the device never receives a failure to
count. Measured with the real browser library (2026-09-24): wrong password ⇒
`KE2 did not verify` on the client and an **abandoned** login on the device — no
KE3, no failure event, nothing. A throttle keyed on failed KE3s would record zero
failures from an attacker trying passwords as fast as the server relays them.

So: every KE2 the device serves is debited against the budget; a KE3 that verifies
refunds it. Two properties follow and must be kept:

- The debit happens **before** the device answers, and an exhausted budget answers
  nothing at all — a refusal that still carried a KE2 would still be an oracle.
- Serving KE1 is cheap for the device (one OPRF evaluation and the 3DH — Argon2 is
  the *client's* cost), so the throttle is about guesses, not CPU; it should not be
  tuned as if it were DoS protection.

Locked by `a_wrong_password_is_decided_at_ke2_so_the_device_never_sees_a_failure`,
which fails loudly if the protocol property it relies on ever stops holding.

### 4c. The session: the login is bound to the transport, and the device decides (P4)

A verified login is worth **one** session, and everything that makes that session
safe is decided on the device, against a key the server never holds — P3b's
`AppKey = HKDF-SHA512(OPAQUE session key, "roomler-extauth-v1 app-key" ‖ attempt ‖ principal)`,
derived independently by the browser and the device.

The binding is a MAC over each end's DTLS certificate fingerprint, one per direction:

`extauth_mac = base64url(HMAC-SHA256(AppKey, "roomler-extauth-v1 transport" ‖ u16be ‖ role ‖ u16be ‖ fingerprint))`,
`role ∈ {offer, answer}`, and `fingerprint` is the SDP's ONE distinct
`a=fingerprint:` value as `lowercase(hash) ␠ UPPERCASE(hex)`. Zero or two distinct
certificates is a refusal: the MAC could cover one while DTLS negotiated the other.
Pinned by known-answer tests computed with Node's HMAC
(`the_transport_mac_matches_an_independent_hmac`), and exercised end to end by an
integration test that implements the browser's half — HKDF included — from this
paragraph rather than from the device's code.

Six refusal points, in the order a session meets them:

| # | Where | Refuses | Why there |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | server — `extauth::handle_session` | an unknown code; a login not verified on this pod, or another principal's, or for another device, or already spent | one login, one session — checked where it is cheapest |
| 2 | server — same | gates 1–2 closed; a quarantined device; an archived org; no `external-session` cap; nothing left after the org's ceiling | the org's gates, re-read at session time — a revocation between login and session holds |
| 3 | device — `extauth::admit_session` | a secondary org's socket; gate 3 off or no password (read LIVE from the file); an unreadable consent mode or ceiling; a ceiling that leaves nothing; no verified login | the device's own terms, never the server's word. The login is consumed LAST, so a refusal on the device's terms leaves it unspent |
| 4 | device — `grant_consent` | a binding that ended while the question stood | a grant for a session that is over is a refusal |
| 5 | device — `check_offer`, ahead of FR-43 delegation | an offer before THIS device consented; a second offer; no MAC; a MAC that does not verify; zero or two certificates | gate 5 is the device's, and an offer is the only thing that builds a peer. Before delegation because the binding lives in the root daemon, not the GUI worker |
| 6 | device — `seal_answer`, and `seal_outbound` for a GUI worker's answer | an answer to no admitted offer; an ended session | an external session's answer is never sent unsealed |

**Why a separate frame** (`rc:extauth.session`) rather than fields on
`rc:session.request`: it names the device by connect code — an outsider never learns
the internal id, and `rc:session.created` answers them with a zero id — and it has no
`local_relay` and no `override_reason`, which closes F4 by type. `ExternalGrant`
reaches `Hub::create_session` from the extauth relay only; `Hub::dispatch` always
passes `None`, so no frame a controller sends can make a session external, or an
external one ordinary.

**Across pods**, P3d's path extends as is: the session is created on the device's pod
with the relay's proxy sender, the origin pod recorded the route when it forwarded
the frame, and the sealed offer and answer cross the PR-2 relay unchanged — the MAC
rides the raw frame (`an_outsider_on_the_other_pod_opens_a_sealed_session`).

## 5. Addressing: how an outsider names a device

An outsider cannot browse the org's device list and must not be able to. They
address the device by a **connect code** — a new field, never `agent_id`, which is an
internal key and an ObjectId (timestamp-prefixed, therefore partly predictable).

**Decision:** 12 characters of Crockford base32 grouped `XXXX-XXXX-XXXX` — 60 bits,
dictatable over a phone, no `I`/`L`/`O`/`U` to mishear. Live-scoped unique index on
the agent row, rotatable by owner or admin; **rotation is the revocation story** when
a code leaks.

Two properties of the resolution endpoint, both easy to get wrong:

- **It is not an existence oracle.** A code that does not exist, a device whose org
  has gate 1 off, and a device that is merely offline must produce the same response
  *and the same latency*. Otherwise the endpoint enumerates the fleet.
- **It is rate-limited before it is useful.** `rate_limit.rs` keys on
  `(caller, device)`; this needs a second keying that works *before* a caller is
  known — per source IP and per code globally.

The capability verb is `RpcCap::ExternalAccess` (`crates/remote_control/src/models.rs:271`),
matched by **equality, never prefix** — the `ssh` / `ssh-consent` rule. A device that
does not advertise it cannot be gate-2 approved, which is what keeps §3's
`controller_scope` prompt from being a promise an old agent silently breaks.

## 6. Five findings from reading master

### F1 — the hub keys controllers by `ObjectId`, so an anonymous principal forks everything

`Hub::register_controller(user_id: ObjectId)` (`crates/remote_control/src/hub.rs:563`),
`RemoteSession.controller_user_id: ObjectId` (`models.rs:2544`), the `remote_audit`
rows and the TURN credential all key on a real user id. A synthetic principal would
fork the session record, the audit, the credential and the rate limiter — and leave
*"someone controlled your machine"* in the log.

### F2 — a user with no org is already legal, so the fix costs one signup and no new type

`routes/auth.rs:108` creates a user and **no tenant**. "Free account, member of
nothing" needs no new identity type: the external controller is an ordinary user who
simply is not a member of the device's tenant. **Decision: an account is required**
for unattended access. For the P6 ad-hoc flow a guest principal minted from a
one-time code is acceptable, because the host is present and watching — the
`routes/consent.rs:20` public-capability route is the established pattern for it.

### F3 — TURN credentials key on the user id, so the meter must key on the *device's* tenant

`turn_creds::ice_servers_for(user_id, …)` (`crates/remote_control/src/turn_creds.rs:358`)
issues under the controller's id. An external controller therefore consumes the org's
relay capacity attributably — but they have **no tenant**, and an external session is
relay-heavy by construction (the outsider is not on the mesh). If FR-20's ledger keys
on the controller's tenant, every external session meters to nothing. **Verify before
P5, do not assume.**

### F4 — `local_relay` is validated as *an* overlay address, not as *the caller's*

`is_overlay_relay_ip` (`crates/remote_control/src/hub.rs:58`) accepts any
`100.64.0.0/10` or `fc00::/7` literal, and `hub.rs:1167` hands it to the agent as a
TURN URL. An external controller has no overlay presence, so for them the field must
be **rejected outright** — otherwise it is a probe into the org's mesh, dialled by
the agent, from outside the org.

### F5 — the unauthenticated capability route already exists

`routes/consent.rs:20` and the UI's `guest: true` `/consent/:token` route are a
working precedent for *the token is the capability*, with single-use resolution via a
CAS. P6 follows it rather than inventing one.

## 7. Phases

| # | Phase | Kill switch | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | Addressing + policy, **no access path**: connect code (globally unique, rotatable), the org switch, `external_access_policy`, admin UI, `external_rc_audit` (90 d TTL). `decide_approval()` returns `Result<(), ExternalRcDenyReason>` so one place records both arms. | `external_rc_enabled = false` (default) | **SHIPPED** — 19 unit + 10 route + 6 integration tests, two guards falsified |
| P2a | **The device can SAY it understands cross-org access, and opt in.** `RpcCap::ExternalAccess` on the hello (unconditional — a BUILD property, the `config` reasoning, never derived from the opt-in) + `external_access_enabled` (gate 3, default off) with its config-surface entry. The whole `external_*` surface is absent from `DesiredConfig`, guarded by a PREFIX test (FR-19's `relay_*` rule). ⚠️ Without this, gate 2 refuses EVERY device — no agent advertises the verb — so P1 is field-unverifiable until it lands. | `external_access_enabled = false` (default) | **SHIPPED** — both guards falsified |
| P2b | The device-side CREDENTIAL as a *type*: the OPAQUE suite (Ristretto255 · TripleDh · **Argon2id** Ksf), the registration record, `external_consent_mode`, `external_max_permissions`. Registration runs entirely on the device — it plays both halves, nothing crosses a network — which is *why* the dashboard can show *set / not set* and CLEAR but never SET. | `external-access` feature, off in every release build | **SHIPPED** — 7 unit tests incl. a full login round-trip |
| P2c | The way to actually set one: `roomler rc password set\|clear\|status` over a new LocalAPI verb, and the length floor. Registration + persistence happen in the DAEMON (it owns the config path and the write lock); the CLI only carries the plaintext across the local pipe, the same channel and the same authority that already flips `exec_enabled`. ⚠️ No `--password` flag, ever — argv is world-readable through `/proc/<pid>/cmdline`. | the P2a flag; nothing verifies the record until P3 | **SHIPPED** — 6 unit tests, incl. the surface allowlist and the derived-`Debug` leak |
| P3a | **The compatibility surface, fixed before any wire exists.** Pinned KSF (`PinnedArgon2`, §4-0), the device's login half (`login_start` KE1→KE2, `login_finish` KE3→session key), and a cross-implementation harness (`examples/extauth_interop.rs`). **Proven against the real browser library**: RED with the old crate-default KSF (the correct password refused), GREEN after pinning with both sides deriving the same session key, and a wrong password decided at KE2 with no KE3 ever sent — the measurement §4b's counting rule rests on. Corrected the spec's browser library (`@cloudflare/opaque-ts` is draft-07 + scrypt; cannot interoperate). | `external-access` feature, in no release build | **SHIPPED** |
| P3b | The device's login **state machine** (`external_logins.rs`): guesses debited when a KE2 leaves the device (§4b), check-and-debit in ONE critical section (a concurrent burst cannot outrun it), a success refunds only its own guess, 5 free then 30 s doubling to a 1 h cap over a 24 h window, bounded pending/verified tables with TTLs, and a verified login retained **single-use** as `AppKey = HKDF-SHA512(session key, label ‖ attempt ‖ principal)` — the principal is bound after the login because the browser library binds no OPAQUE `context`. Known-answer test against an independent HKDF. Open decisions 6 + 7. | same | **SHIPPED** |
| P3c | The wire: `rc:extauth.*` frames (4 client, 4 server; the device's refusal decoded leniently — anything present is a refusal), the server as a blind relay (`crates/modules/remote/src/extauth.rs`: byte-identical `unavailable` for no-such-code / gate 1 / gate 2 / offline, reply before the audit write, park-before-push, only the starter finishes, gates re-checked at KE3), the device's answer in **every** build (`agents/roomlerd/src/extauth.rs`: gate 3 and the record read LIVE from the config file, primary org only), and a `login` audit action. **Proven on loopback against the real agent**: `crates/tests/src/extauth_tests.rs`, 4 tests. ⚠️ **Single-pod only** — see P3d. | P2's flag; no client surface ships | **SHIPPED** |
| P3d | **Cross-pod.** An outsider has NO tenant, so tenant affinity cannot put their socket on the pod holding the device, and `/ws` refuses a `tid` they are not a member of — in a 2-replica deployment roughly half of them land on a pod that cannot reach it. The landing pod re-resolves the connect code and forwards the raw frame ONCE over the PR-2 rc relay (`Hop::Origin` → `Hop::Relayed`, never relayed twice); the owner pod's `rc.cmd` handler routes it to the extauth relay with the proxy sender, whose pump already routes replies back to the browser's connection. `finish` resolves the code BEFORE the attempt table, because an attempt started cross-pod lives on the other pod. Proven by `an_outsider_on_the_other_pod_still_logs_in` (device on pod 1, outsider on pod 2), falsified by disabling the forward. | same | **SHIPPED** |
| P4 | Session establishment — §4c. Designed as its own frame (`rc:extauth.session`) rather than a branch in `resolve_session_authz`: an outsider has no membership for that gate to judge, and the frame's TYPE is what keeps a connect code, not an agent id, on the wire and `local_relay` off it (F4). | per sub-phase, below | P4a–P4d **SHIPPED** on the branch; P4e–P4f not started |
| P4a | **The wire and the binding primitive.** `rc:extauth.session`; `Request.external`; `extauth_mac` on the offer and the answer in both directions (relayed verbatim — the server holds no key to check it); `RpcCap::ExternalSession`; `external_logins`' binding — bind (consuming the login) → the device's consent → ONE offer → a sealed answer → the key dropped and the id remembered. KATs from an independent HMAC. | `external-access` feature, in no release build | **SHIPPED** |
| P4b | **The server's session step** (`extauth::handle_session`): a verified login kept single-use for 150 s; gates 1–2, quarantine and archived re-checked; the `external-session` cap; the org's clamp; `Hub::create_session(external)` — the only caller that passes one; a `session` audit action joined to the login by `attempt_id` and to the session by `session_id`; the FILES grandfather rule skipped; a zero agent id to the outsider. | same | **SHIPPED** |
| P4c | **The device's admission**: primary org only; gate 3 read live; its own consent mode and ceiling (now validated at `config set`); the login consumed last; the MAC checked ahead of FR-43 delegation; the answer sealed at both places an answer leaves the root daemon; audio behind `AUDIO`; the prompt titled "from OUTSIDE your organization"; a refusal ends the session as `agent_hangup`, never reported as a human's no. | same | **SHIPPED** |
| P4d | **The proof, against the real agent**: a sealed session end to end with the browser's half written from the spec; three forged offers each ENDED by the device; one login, one session, one principal; and the same session across two pods with both MACs crossing the PR-2 relay intact. | same | **SHIPPED** |
| P4e | The public `/connect` page: `@serenity-kit/opaque` login, WebCrypto AppKey and MACs, the answer's MAC checked BEFORE `setRemoteDescription`, a clear refusal on a missing one. | no route ships | not started |
| P4f | Turn it on: `external-access` into the release feature sets; the first field run on an installed daemon with a real second account; `vs-teamviewer.md`. | gate 3 per device, default off | not started |
| P5 | Visibility + accounting: owner notification on a first-ever external session by a principal and on repeated failures; audit UI beside `SshAuditSection`; per-principal revocation; relay bytes metered to the device's tenant (F3); a plan limit. | n/a — read-only surfaces | not started |
| P6 | Ad-hoc attended support: host generates a short one-time code from tray/CLI. **Same wire** — the one-time secret takes the password's place. | separate `external_rc_mode` value; independent of unattended access | not started |

## 8. Acceptance criteria

- [ ] With `external_rc_mode = off` (the default), a valid connect code + correct
      password yields the **same response and latency** as a code that does not exist.
- [ ] With gates 1 and 2 open but `external_access_enabled = false`, the session is
      refused **by the device**, and the refusal is audited.
- [ ] A server that is asked to start an external session **without** a client proof
      cannot: demonstrated by driving the mint path directly against a real agent.
- [ ] The password never appears in any server-side log, request body, or collection.
      Demonstrated by a capture of the full exchange. **The device-side half is
      done (P2c)**: `an_external_password_persists_and_never_lands_in_the_config_file`
      asserts it against the config file's RAW bytes, and
      `a_password_never_prints_itself_through_debug` covers the daemon log by
      making `Request`'s derived `Debug` safe. Both falsified. The *server*-side
      half needs the P3 exchange to exist before it can be captured.
- [x] A password cannot be SET from anywhere but the device. **P2c** — no server
      route writes it, `config set` refuses both credential keys, and
      `no_external_credential_key_is_editable_through_the_config_surface`
      allowlists the editable `external_*` keys so the next one added has to be
      defended rather than inherited. Falsified by registering the verifier.
- [ ] An SDP offer whose DTLS fingerprint is not authenticated under `K` is refused
      by the agent (negative arm run explicitly — a pass with no failing arm proves
      nothing).
- [ ] A `DesiredConfig` push carrying any `external_*` key is rejected, and a test
      asserts the fields cannot be serialised into one.
- [ ] An external controller's `local_relay` is rejected (F4), with a log line.
- [ ] The host consent prompt names the controller as **outside the organization**,
      verified on a real device with a real second account.
- [x] Every refusal reason appears in `external_rc_audit`, and the audit read is
      gated on `VIEW_REMOTE_AUDIT`. **P1** — `approval_is_compound_clearing_is_not_and_both_arms_are_audited`
      asserts 2 refusals + 1 approve + 1 clear = 4 rows, and that a plain member gets 403
      from the reader. Falsified: dropping half the gate turns it red.
- [ ] Relay bytes from an external session appear against the **device's** org in the
      FR-20 ledger (F3), with a direct-path arm metering zero.
- [x] Rotating a connect code invalidates the old one immediately. **P1** — one route
      mints and rotates, and the row holds exactly one code, so the old value is gone
      rather than retired (`a_connect_code_is_minted_on_demand_…`).
- [x] A connect code never reaches the ordinary device list, which needs only tenant
      MEMBERSHIP. **P1**, and the criterion was missing from this list until the
      implementation surfaced it — `…never_reaches_the_device_list`, falsified by
      adding the field to `AgentResponse` and watching it go red.
- [ ] `docs/compare/vs-teamviewer.md:63` is updated — and only after the field run,
      not on merge.

## 9. Open decisions

1. **Does gate 2 apply when the device owner is also the org's only admin?** As
   specified, a solo owner clicks approve on their own device — friction with no
   safety gain. A `MANAGE_TENANT`-holder-owns-the-device shortcut is tempting and is
   exactly the shape of the FR-27 owner shortcut that made `consent_mode` invisible
   for a year. Default: **no shortcut**; revisit with evidence.
2. **Where does an external session appear in the device's own UI?** A session the
   org's admins cannot see would be worse than the gap it closes; a session that
   spams every admin is noise. Proposal: the existing session list, badged, plus a
   notification on the *first* session per principal only.
3. **Does an external principal get `FILES` / `CLIPBOARD` by default?** The internal
   default is `VIEW | INPUT | CLIPBOARD` (+ the grandfathered `FILES`). Proposal for
   external: `VIEW | INPUT` only, with the rest reachable through gate 2's ceiling.
4. **Plan tier.** This is the feature that replaces a paid TeamViewer seat
   (`docs/business-model.md`), so it is a pricing lever, not just a limit. Needs a
   decision before P5, not after.
5. **Gate 2 is weaker than FR-19's, and P1 says so rather than implying otherwise.**
   The spec called `MANAGE_AGENTS` + `REMOTE_CONTROL` "the FR-19 shape". It is not:
   FR-19 pairs `MANAGE_AGENTS` with `EXEC_DEVICE`, which `DEFAULT_ADMIN` deliberately
   does NOT carry, so it is a real extra grant — whereas `DEFAULT_ADMIN` **does** carry
   `REMOTE_CONTROL`, so this pair is no hurdle for the seeded `admin` role and bites
   only on a custom role built without it. Shipped as-is deliberately: the design does
   not lean on gate 2 as the security boundary (the org switch, the device opt-in and
   the device-held password are), and borrowing `EXEC_DEVICE` would exclude the natural
   approver — a fleet admin holding no root-command grant — to buy a hurdle nothing
   depends on. A dedicated bit waits on the BigInt migration. Locked by
   `the_compound_gate_does_not_restrict_a_default_admin`, so the claim cannot rot.
6. **The guess window is in memory (P3b), so a daemon restart forgives it.**
   Persisting it would put a disk write on an attacker-driven path and a second
   writer beside the config's lock; not persisting it costs at most one day's
   budget per restart. An attacker cannot restart the daemon without local access or
   a crash bug — and a crash bug that doubled as a budget reset is the case worth
   watching for. Shipped in memory; revisit if the crash recorder ever shows a
   restart loop correlated with external-login traffic.
7. **There is no hard lockout (P3b), only a capped backoff.** A lockout that needs
   the owner to re-arm it turns anyone who knows the connect code — which is dictated
   aloud and is not a secret — into someone who can switch external access off at
   will. The cap (≈34 answered guesses a day against a ≥12-character password) is
   the trade. P5's owner notification on repeated failures is the complement: a
   human learns of a sustained attack, and rotating the connect code ends it.
8. **The prompt names the outsider by a name they chose (P4).** The TITLE now says
   the request is from outside the organization, and the detail line says what it
   rests on — but "Alice from IT" is still whatever the account calls itself, and
   the classic support scam is built on exactly that. Proposal: show the account's
   email too, when (and only when) it is a PROVEN address (the security baseline's
   rule for `users.email`), and say "unverified" otherwise. Needs a decision before
   P4f puts the prompt in front of real people.
9. **A device-side narrowing is enforced but not SHOWN (P4).** When the device's
   own `external_max_permissions` is narrower than the org's, the device enforces
   its grant (the input and clipboard channels refuse), but the viewer's toolbar
   follows `rc:session.created`, which carries the server's clamp. Honest options:
   the device reports its effective grant in `rc:consent` (additive), or the page
   treats refusals as the signal. P4e should pick one; the safe property — the
   device enforces its own ceiling — does not depend on it.
10. **One login, one offer — so a reconnect costs a login (P4).** An external session
    admits exactly one offer, because the device rebuilds its peer for each and
    nothing about a second offer is covered by the consent the first got. A network
    blip therefore sends the outsider back to the password. A reconnect ticket
    derived from the AppKey (MAC'd, single-use, short-lived, and still subject to the
    device's consent mode) would remove that without a server-side secret; deferred
    until the page exists and the cost can be measured.
11. **Who may turn `external-access` on in the release builds (P4f).** Every gate
    is default-closed, so shipping the stack changes nothing on a device until its
    owner opts in (gate 3) and sets a password — but it does put the OPAQUE stack
    (+7 crates) into every agent. The alternative is a separate build flavour; the
    proposal is to ship it in `full`, because a feature only some builds can serve is
    one the fleet view has to explain device by device.
12. **The page cannot run its OPAQUE client under today's CSP (found while planning
    P4e).** `@serenity-kit/opaque` is opaque-ke compiled to WebAssembly, and the SPA's
    policy (`files/nginx-pod.conf:62`) is `script-src 'self' https://purestat.ai` —
    with no `'wasm-unsafe-eval'`, a browser refuses to compile any WebAssembly module,
    so the login would fail before its first frame. The CSP is one per document, and
    SPA navigation never re-fetches it, so the allowance cannot be scoped to
    `/connect` alone. Proposal: add `'wasm-unsafe-eval'` — it permits compiling
    WebAssembly and nothing else (not JS `eval`) — in the same change as the page,
    exercising the remote-control page as the security baseline requires for any CSP
    edit, and extending the `rc_local_turn.rs` test that already parses this header.

## 10. Out of scope

- **Mobile device support** — the other half of what `vs-teamviewer.md` concedes.
  Unrelated mechanism, separate FR.
- **Unattended access without a device password** (e.g. a bearer link that grants
  control). It would put the gate back in the server.
- **Setting the password remotely.** §4. Deliberately impossible, not merely unbuilt.
- **Changing the internal authorization path.** Nothing here may loosen
  `resolve_session_authz` for org members.
- **Session recording of external sessions.** The `ssh_activity` reasoning applies:
  recording what an operator typed ships it off the host.

## 12. Field-verification log

| date | version | what was tested | result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-09-01 | branch `fr52-cross-org-remote-access` | P1 on the dev box: `cargo test -p roomler-ai-remote-control --lib` (223 pass, 19 new), `cargo test -p roomler-ai-api --lib` (290 pass; the one failure, `auth_rate_limit::tokens_refill_over_time`, is a load-timing flake — 3/3 green in isolation, and the file is untouched by this branch), `cargo test -p roomler-ai-tests -- external_access_tests` (6/6), `bun run build` + `bun run test:unit` (949 pass), `cargo fmt --check` and `cargo clippy --all-targets -D warnings` on the four touched crates | PASS |
| 2026-09-01 | same | **Falsification.** Removed the `REMOTE_CONTROL` half of gate 2 and added `connect_code` to `AgentResponse`, then re-ran: exactly `approval_is_compound_…` and `…never_reaches_the_device_list` went red with the intended messages, the other four stayed green. Reverted; all 6 green again. A test that has never failed proves nothing. | PASS |
| 2026-09-23 | branch `fr52-p2b` | **P2c on the dev box.** `fmt` · `apply-spdx --check` · clippy (localapi + node-core + cli; roomlerd; roomlerd `--features external-access`) · `cargo check -p roomler-ai-tunnel-core --features overlay-l3,overlay-netstack --all-targets` · 261 unit tests. Plus **natively on Windows**, which is the lane that matters here — `rpassword` compiles against the Windows console API and the WSL lane cannot see it (`librpassword-*.rlib` confirmed in the Windows `target/debug/deps`; forced clippy on `roomler-cli` + `roomler-localapi`, rc=0). | PASS |
| 2026-09-23 | same | **Falsification, five guards.** floor → `len()`; a change → always mint a fresh `ServerSetup`; `Secret::Debug` → print the inner string; register `external_access_verifier` on the config surface; **leak the plaintext into another config field**. Each went RED with its own message and was reverted. The last is the end-to-end test asserting the password is absent from the config file's RAW bytes. | PASS |
| 2026-09-23 | **live 0.4.99 SYSTEM service** | **`roomler rc password status` against a REAL, pre-P2c daemon.** The request reached the daemon and came back — proving transport and dispatch — but a daemon that does not know these verbs cannot *refuse* them, it cannot **parse** them, so serde answered `unknown variant …` followed by all 22 verb names it does know, and nothing actionable. Fixed: an additive hint naming the actual problem (daemon older than the CLI), with the raw error kept underneath, because matching a foreign library's wording must degrade to noise and never to a misdiagnosis. Exit code 1, as it should be. **No unit test could have produced this**; it is the reason a live run is not optional. | FIXED |
| 2026-09-24 | branch `fr52-p2b` + P3a | **Cross-implementation interop, run 1 — the negative control, on the code as shipped in #1563.** `examples/extauth_interop.rs` (built natively on Windows) registers a password exactly as `rc password set` does and answers one login over stdio; the client is the real `@serenity-kit/opaque@1.1.0` under bun 1.4.1, library defaults. **Correct password → `finishLogin returned nothing — KE2 did not verify`**; the device saw an abandoned login. Cause: the device registered with `argon2::Argon2::default()` (19 MiB, t=2, p=1), the browser stretches with 64 MiB, t=3, p=4. | **FAIL — as predicted** |
| 2026-09-24 | same, KSF pinned | **Run 2.** Same harness after `PinnedArgon2`. Correct password → client `finishLogin OK in 157 ms`, device `OK`, and `sha256(session key)` identical on both sides (`f579ee9c…`). Browser↔device login is proven with the real library, not inferred from a shared crate. | **PASS** |
| 2026-09-24 | same | **Run 3 — wrong password.** Client: `KE2 did not verify` after 155 ms. Device: `FAIL abandoned: no KE3`. The client learns the answer from KE2 alone and the device never receives a failure — the measurement §4b's "debit at KE1" rule is built on. | **PASS** (the property holds) |
| 2026-09-24 | P3a + P3b | **Falsification, four guards.** (a) KSF one pass fewer → the independent-Argon2id known-answer test RED. (b) **Release the lock during the OPAQUE step** (the "free the lock during crypto" refactor) → a 16-thread burst had **16 of 16** KE1s answered against a budget of 5, in 3 of 3 runs — not a few extra guesses, the throttle gone. (c) A success resets the streak → exactly `a_success_refunds_its_own_guess_not_the_streak` RED, 14 green. (d) **The obvious design — debit on a failed KE3** → **8 of 15** RED, including "an abandoned login is an answered guess — counting only failed KE3s counts nothing". All reverted. | PASS |
| 2026-09-24 | P3c | **The loopback proof.** A real API server, the REAL `roomlerd` signalling loop (`external-access`) reading a real config file, an org-less account on a real user socket, opaque-ke standing in for the browser library P3a proved compatible. (1) Correct password → KE1 → device → KE2 → client → KE3 → device → **VERIFIED**, and a `login` row in the org's audit log. (2) Five wrong passwords, each decided in the client at KE2 and never finished → the sixth knock **throttled through the real server** (`retry_after_secs` 29: real time passed and the wait rounds up). (3) No-such-code, gate 1 off, gate 2 withdrawn → three byte-identical `{"t":"rc:extauth.result","refused":"unavailable"}`. (4) A stranger holding a valid KE3 for someone else's attempt → `unknown_attempt`, and the owner still verifies. Composition baseline: +12 / −0, exactly the eight wire names and four owners. | PASS |
| 2026-09-24 | P3c | **Falsification of the two server properties**, one run, both mutations: a distinguishable gate refusal → the identical-refusals test RED (`other` ≠ `unavailable`); the server's starter check removed → the only-the-starter test RED (`rejected`, not `unknown_attempt`). Each mutation turned exactly its own test red. Note the second: with the server's check gone, the stranger's KE3 reached the device — and the **device's** principal check still refused it. Two independent layers, observed. | PASS |
| 2026-09-24 | P3d | **Cross-pod, two pods over one bus** (`TestApp::spawn_pair`, a real Redis): the device homed on pod 1, the outsider's socket on pod 2. KE1 → relayed → the device → KE2 → back over the conn-addressed lane → KE3 → relayed → **VERIFIED** — including `finish`, whose attempt existed only on pod 1. **Falsified**: with the forward disabled, exactly this test fails (`unavailable` where the device's challenge was expected) and the four single-pod tests stay green, so it exercises the relay rather than a shared hub. The test announces `SKIPPED` without a bus instead of passing on nothing. | PASS |
| 2026-09-24 | P3c prep | ⚠️ **Found while rebasing onto FR-83: no CI lane runs `roomler-ai-remote-control`'s unit tests.** Every "locked by test" guard in that crate — including `ssh_does_not_imply_ssh_consent` and this FR's own `DesiredConfig` prefix guard and `external_access_tests` — has only run locally; two FR-78 tests have been red there since Vulkan became a known backend. Separately, the ClientMsg owner-table test could not run on a Windows checkout at all (CRLF; fixed here). Reported, not fixed: adding the lane needs the FR-78 tests repaired first. | reported |
| 2026-09-25 | branch `fr52-p4` | **P4 unit tests on the dev box.** roomlerd with `external-access` (the binding: KATs against Node's HMAC, normalisation and the one-certificate rule, the whole lifecycle, refuse-never-evict, the ended memory, the TTL, and a REAL login's key equal to the key the client derives from its own side) — 48 in the touched modules; `external-session` advertised exactly with the feature, checked both ways; Hub 150 (incl. the external session's zero id, its `Request.external` and the FILES rule it skips); relay 4; remote-control 215 (the 2 stale FR-78 tests skipped, as on master); node-core's `config set` validation. `fmt`; `clippy -D warnings` on roomlerd with and without the feature, the server crates `--all-targets`, `--workspace`, and CI's api+services+tests `--all-targets` lane; the tunnel-core feature check. Composition baseline **+2 / −0**: exactly `rc:extauth.session` and its owner, `remote`. | PASS |
| 2026-09-25 | same | **The P4 proof against the real agent** — `extauth_tests.rs`, with the browser's half written from §4c rather than from the device's code (HKDF built from two HMACs). (1) A verified login opens a session; `rc:session.created` carries a zero id; the offer's MAC verifies; the answer comes back sealed over the DEVICE's certificate under the same key; the browser's peer accepts it; the org's log has a `session` row naming the session and the login. (2) Three forged offers — another key, no MAC, a genuine tag over a swapped certificate — each **ENDED by the device** (`agent_hangup`), never answered. (3) Another outsider holding the attempt id, a second ask on the same login, and a never-verified attempt: all `unknown_attempt`. (4) **Two pods**: device on pod 1, outsider on pod 2, both MACs across the PR-2 relay intact. 10/10 with the P3 tests and the composition gate, 61 s. | PASS |
| 2026-09-25 | same | **Falsification, six guards, each RED on its own test only.** Against the real agent, one run: (M1) the device ignores the offer's MAC → `an_offer_the_login_did_not_seal_ends_the_session` RED — the forged offer was ANSWERED; (M2) the server drops the principal check → `a_login_opens_one_session_for_its_own_principal` RED — outsider B got `rc:session.created` on A's login; (M3) the device never seals → both sealed-session tests RED (one pod and two) — an answer with no MAC; the five P3 tests stayed green. Units, one run: (M4) the Hub's FILES rule without its external guard → the outsider got `VIEW \| INPUT \| CLIPBOARD \| FILES`; (M5) no cap on the binding table → a 33rd session admitted; (M6) the login consumed FIRST → caught. ⚠️ **M6 was caught only after the test was fixed**: the first version re-admitted the SAME session id to prove the login survived, and re-admission on the same login is deliberately idempotent (the Hub re-pushes a pending Request after a socket flap) — so it would have passed with the mutation in. Found by designing the mutation before running it; the survivor check now admits a fresh id. Also found while designing M1: removing only `check_offer` does NOT turn anything red, because the seal step refuses an answer to an offer that was never admitted — a second, independent layer. All reverted. | PASS |
| — | — | **Still unrun: an INSTALLED daemon.** The login loop against a real agent is now proven in-process (P3c, above), and the `rc password` LocalAPI path live against the installed service (P2c). What no run has touched is both on one installed host: the LocalAPI pipe name is a compile-time constant and the singleton instance lock stops a second daemon coexisting with the service, so it needs `external-access` in a release build. That belongs with P4 — the first phase whose feature an operator could actually use — not before it. | — |
