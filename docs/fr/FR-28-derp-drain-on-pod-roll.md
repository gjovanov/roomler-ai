# FR-28: A pod roll freezes every relay-carried session

Status: **P0 disproven and reverted; P1 is the fix** (2026-08-29). Tracking issue: `FR-28` (#865).
Child of the RC-quality program; sibling of FR-18 (carrier queue discipline).

## The measurement

Driving a live session through the browser on 2026-08-29 caught a **2436 ms
`video DC delivery gap` + decode stall on an IDLE session** — no dragging, nothing
to blame on the encoder. Correlating the agent logs against pod age gave an exact,
repeatable chain:

```
pod roll → /derp WS closed under the relay carrier → carrier rebuild
        → video DC delivery gap → decode stall → visible freeze
```

Both hosts, same second, against pods 69 s old:

| time | host | line |
|---|---|---|
| `10:26:57Z` | CORPLAP-3 | `overlay: relay carrier send hard-errored (/derp WS closed under it)` ×3 |
| `10:26:56Z` | CORPLAP-2 | `overlay: control-WS reattached — re-joined with carriers intact` |
| `10:27:01Z` | CORPLAP-3 | `overlay: control-WS reattached — re-joined with carriers intact` |

An earlier instance recovered in **~4 s** (`08:36:34 → 08:36:38`).

🔑 **DERP churn is otherwise rare** — 2–3 events per host per 6 h, *all* correlating
with rolls. So this is not a flaky-network story: it is self-inflicted, and it is
the one freeze cause that can be reproduced on demand.

## Root cause

The agent learns the `/derp` WS is gone **by failing to send on it**. Nothing tells
it in advance, so the sequence is: pod dies → agent keeps handing frames to a dead
socket → a send hard-errors → `DeathReason::HardDead`
(`crates/tunnel-core/src/overlay/runtime/establish.rs:659-668`) → carrier rebuild →
`MuxEvent::Recovered` opens the fast-walk window
(`crates/tunnel-core/src/overlay/runtime.rs:2591-2597`).

That recovery path has already been optimised once (#28: `DERP_RECOVERY_WALK_WINDOW`
+ `DERP_RECOVERY_RECHECK`, after a field case where "the WS returned in 1.5 s and the
floor still took 5 s more"). The remaining cost is upstream of it — the time spent
not knowing.

⚠️ **The pod knows it is going away and does not say so.** `main.rs:244-266` already
runs `shutdown_cleanup` on SIGTERM before axum stops accepting, and
`ws/derp.rs:80-85` already defines a **`DerpCancelRegistry`** whose entire purpose is
"fire it to rehome a socket parked on the wrong pod; the socket loop's cancel arm
breaks, teardown releases the directory record, and the client's reconnect re-lands
per the current LB map". The primitive exists and is simply not wired to shutdown.

## Design — announce the death instead of letting it be discovered

**P0. Fire every `/derp` cancel on SIGTERM.** ❌ **DISPROVEN AND REVERTED** (#867,
#874, reverted in the PR that carries this edit). In the existing shutdown hook, walk
`DerpCancelRegistry` and notify each connection before the process stops accepting.
Each agent gets a clean close at T+0 rather than discovering it at first-failed-send,
and re-lands on the surviving pod through the normal reconnect.

⚠️ This is **not** the pre-close HTTP draining that `main.rs:249-253` deliberately
rejects ("maxSurge=0 means every drained second is downtime for this node"). It adds
no delay: it is a broadcast on the way out, and the process stops accepting exactly
when it does today.

⚠️ Kill switch: `ROOMLER__DERP__DRAIN_ON_SHUTDOWN` (default on once proven; off ⇒
today's behaviour byte-for-byte).

### Why P0 failed — the premise, not the primitive

Three rolls, same three hosts, deliberate:

| roll | terminating pods | `hard-errored` |
|---|---|---|
| `11:41:01Z` | no drain (baseline) | 8 |
| `11:42:26Z` | drain via `notify_waiters` | 12 |
| `12:20:23Z` | drain via `notify_one` | **10** |

Recovery did not improve either: baseline 4-28 s, `notify_one` 16-58 s.

The first round also had a real bug — `notify_waiters` drops a signal when no task is
parked, and the socket loop rebuilds its `notified()` future every `select!` iteration,
so exactly the BUSY sockets missed it. Fixing that to `notify_one` moved the number from
12 to 10. It did not fix the freeze, because:

⚠️ **Closing the socket early IS the announcement, and any close — graceful or not —
fails the agent's in-flight sends.** That is precisely what `relay carrier send
hard-errored (/derp WS closed under it)` reports: it marks *a close*, not an *ungraceful*
one. The cost was never in DISCOVERING the death. It is in having **no carrier at all**
between the old WS closing and a replacement being up, and telling the agent sooner only
starts that window sooner.

🔑 The acceptance criterion ("the `hard-errored` line must disappear") was a good
falsifier and did its job. The reasoning it was testing was wrong.

**P1. Reconnect-before-close — the actual fix.** The agent opens the replacement `/derp`
WS and moves carriers across **while the old socket still carries**: the make-before-break
the overlay already does for carrier upgrades. Only overlap closes the gap.

The trigger should be an application-level "going away" frame, precisely because it can
be delivered **without closing anything** — which is the property P0 lacked. The server
half is small (emit the frame on SIGTERM, then behave as today); the work is agent-side:
hold two sockets, move carriers, retire the old one.

⚠️ Scope note: this is an AGENT change, so it ships on the agent release cadence and
reaches the fleet gradually, unlike P0 which was server-only. A server that emits the
frame to an agent too old to understand it must be a no-op.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] A deliberate `kubectl rollout restart` with a live relay-carried session
      produces **no `video DC delivery gap` > 500 ms** in the viewer console
      (today: 2436 ms measured).
- [ ] Agent-side `relay carrier send hard-errored (/derp WS closed under it)`
      **disappears** for a graceful roll — the carrier should be rebuilt from a
      clean close, not from a failed send. Its continued presence means P0 did not
      take, regardless of what the timings say.
- [ ] Time from pod SIGTERM to `control-WS reattached` drops below the ~4 s measured.
- [ ] No regression in rollout duration — the deploy must not get slower, since the
      whole reason pre-close draining was rejected is that surge is 0.
- [ ] Verified on ≥2 hosts in one roll, since the failure is fleet-wide by nature.

## Out of scope

- The reconnect/backoff ladder itself (already tuned by #28).
- Non-graceful pod death (SIGKILL, node loss). Nothing can be announced there; that
  case keeps today's discover-by-failure path, which is why P0 cannot be the only
  defence and the existing recovery walk stays.
- Making RC sessions survive a roll without any interruption — that is a bigger
  design (session migration) and is not what this FR claims.

## Field log

| date | build | result |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-08-29 | 0.4.15 | Measured: 2436 ms delivery gap + decode stall on an idle session; chain confirmed on 2 hosts against a 69 s-old pod; ~4 s SIGTERM→reattach in an earlier instance. FR filed. |
| 2026-08-29 | 0.4.17 | **P0 DISPROVEN over three deliberate rolls** (8 / 12 / 10 `hard-errored`; recovery no better). Premise wrong: the agent was never late to notice, it was carrier-less either way. P0 reverted rather than left default-ON looking like a fix. The two notify-semantics tests are KEPT — `notify_waiters` losing a signal when nobody is parked is a general hazard wherever a `select!` loop is signalled. |

## P1 — concrete design (scoped, NOT implemented)

The structure is favourable. `DerpMux` already outlives its socket: *"the outbound
receiver lives for the mux's whole life (across reconnects), so a reconnect never severs
the `DerpConn`→WS path"* (`transport/derp.rs:325-330`). Carriers hang off the mux, not
off the socket, so a socket swap need not be visible to them at all.

What makes today's reconnect visible is `mark_down()` — the agent's WS loop
(`agents/roomlerd/src/derp.rs:200-240`) is shaped
`loop { connect; register; mark_up; inner select; mark_down; backoff }`, and every
iteration owns one `tx`/`rx` pair. `mark_down` is what withholds carrier builds and
ultimately drives the freeze.

**The change**: on a "going away" signal, dial and register a SECOND socket, swap `tx`,
retire the old `rx` — **without ever calling `mark_down`**. The mux stays up, carriers
never notice, and the visible outage is the swap itself (one dial, sub-second) rather
than a full down→backoff→up→walk cycle.

Server half is small: emit the frame in the existing SIGTERM hook, then behave exactly as
today. Agent half is the work: the loop must hold two sockets briefly and move the write
half across.

### ⚠️ Why this needs its own cycle, not a bolt-on

`derp.rs` IS the connectivity floor — *"with every UDP path blocked, DERP over TLS :443
still carries the mesh"* is commitment #2 in CLAUDE.md. A defect in this loop does not
degrade the mesh, it removes the floor, and on exactly the corp-VPN hosts that have no
other carrier. That earns a design pass, review, and a staged rollout of its own.

Specific hazards to design against, all visible in the current loop:

- **A failed second dial must not cost the first socket.** The old `tx` has to keep
  carrying until the new one is registered, so the swap is commit-on-success. Getting
  this backwards converts a graceful roll into a hard outage — strictly worse than today.
- **The registration frame is the first frame on a socket** (`derp.rs:217`). The new
  socket is not usable until that lands, so "registered" is the swap point, not
  "connected".
- **Both sockets are registered under the same pubkey for an instant.** The server's
  registry is last-writer-wins (`ws/derp.rs:448-451` deregisters only `if` still ours),
  so the overlap is safe by construction — but that property is load-bearing and should
  be asserted, not assumed.
- **Ungraceful death still exists.** SIGKILL and node loss cannot be announced, so the
  discover-by-failed-send path and the #28 recovery walk both stay. P1 removes the cost
  of the *graceful* case only.

### Value, stated honestly

This is worth doing, but it is not the largest RC-quality lever: it affects only sessions
live during a deploy. The measured win of this whole arc so far is the FR-22 probe cache
(#861, up to 1.9 s off a reconnect, shipped). P1 should be picked up deliberately, not
because it is the last thing left open.
