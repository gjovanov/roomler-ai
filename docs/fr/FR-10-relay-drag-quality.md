# FR-10: Relay drag quality — IDR thrift on constrained transports

> **CLOSED 2026-08-27** — issue #783 is closed and its acceptance criteria are met. Any status line below is the state while the work was in flight, kept as the record.

**Status:** shipped in `agent-v0.4.5` (#785); field gate pending.
Tracking issue: `FR-10` in gjovanov/roomler-ai/issues. Child of FR-1 (#767), which
gated the direct-path rate machinery off relay and left goodput observe-only there.

## Goal

Window-drag over a RELAY session (corp-VPN hosts: CORPLAP-3, CORPLAP-2) should feel as smooth
as the pipe's physics allow — no multi-second "lumps" — while keeping the crisp-text
properties of the direct path. Field read (2026-08-27, neo16 → CORPLAP-3 on 0.4.x): direct
paths are "nice"; CORPLAP-3 via relay is "slightly bulky".

## Root cause (from CORPLAP-3's own heartbeats, session `6a9021e6…`, 11:39–11:40Z)

av1_qsv 1920×1200@30, relay RTT 88–105 ms, target ≈ pipe (~1.5–2 Mbps delivered):

- **Steady-state flow is HEALTHY**: `send_wait_avg_ms` 0.05–0.27, skips ~0.2/s,
  `frames_dropped_backpressure` 0. The relay carries the delta stream fine.
- **The "bulky" is single-frame IDR LUMPS**: `bytes_inflight` spikes 82→262→334 KB
  exactly at each `idle-settle keyframe` (one per drag-pause, ~every 6 s) and each
  `deferred bitrate applied at quiet` re-open (3 in 30 s, each a fresh IDR). One
  ~300 KB frame ≈ **1.2–1.5 s of pipe time**; everything behind it queues in SCTP.
  The constrained byte gate (450 ms budget = ~168 KB) cannot help: the lump is ONE
  frame, already encoded, larger than the whole budget.
- av1's HRD floor makes the lumps legal: `av1_*` is pinned at bufsize = 2×maxrate
  (rc.443 — Intel AV1 VDENC ERRORS on an over-reservoir IDR rather than clamping),
  so shrinking the reservoir is NOT an available lever for AV1.
- **Correction to FR-1's relay note**: the goodput v2 estimator doesn't "crash" on
  this relay — it **never samples** (`goodput_samples: "(0, 1)"`): SCTP's own buffer
  absorbs bursts instantly, so per-frame serialisation is sub-ms and no ≥10 ms
  blocked-send ever occurs. Measuring relay drainage would need SCTP-level feedback;
  out of scope here (and the ceiling was not the problem in this trace).
- Base RTT 88–105 ms is physics (DERP/TURN path) — not addressable by the encoder.

## Key design — `relay_idr_thrift` (default ON, one knob)

On a **reliable, ordered** DataChannel nothing is ever lost, so the idle-settle IDR
is a QUALITY refresh, not a correctness need — the correctness path is the
request-driven resync (browser backlog-shed → `rc:keyframe` → forced IDR), which
stays untouched. On a thin relay a full-frame refresh costs more in lag than it buys
in crispness; CQ deltas re-crystallise the static image progressively anyway (the
rc.234 argument).

Under `relay_idr_thrift` (env `ROOMLERD_RELAY_IDR_THRIFT`, `0` restores):

1. **Settle-IDR suppression on constrained transports** — both DC pumps skip the
   `idle-settle keyframe` when the session is constrained; a heartbeat counter
   (`settle_kf_suppressed`) makes the suppression visible in the field.
2. **Deferred-apply spacing on constrained** — the quiet-flush of a deferred AIMD
   target (each flush = QSV/AMF re-open = another IDR) applies at most once per
   15 s unless the move is large (≥40 % relative), so rung-hopping (3 re-opens in
   the 30 s trace) collapses to ~1 while a genuine collapse still lands promptly.

Untouched: request-driven resyncs, lock-transition IDRs, dims-change rebuilds, the
direct path entirely, and every FR-1 mechanism.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Relay drag session heartbeats: `bytes_inflight` spikes >150 KB only for
      requested resyncs; zero `idle-settle keyframe` lines while constrained
      (counter climbing instead); ≤1 `deferred bitrate applied` per 15 s
- [x] Field: CORPLAP-3-from-neo16 drag no longer "bulky" (or clearly reduced); post-motion
      text still crystallises within ~1–2 s via deltas
- [x] Direct sessions byte-identical in behaviour (settle IDRs still fire there)
- [ ] `relay_idr_thrift=0` restores the previous relay behaviour

## Open decisions

1. Relay-measured ceiling still needs an SCTP-level drainage signal
   (`buffered_amount` polling or DERP-side feedback) — separate follow-up if the
   post-thrift feel still lags the pipe's physics.
2. Whether the browser's adaptive-resolution ladder should weigh relay RTT.

## Out of scope

- The 88–105 ms base RTT (DERP/TURN path selection is the overlay's domain).
- AV1 HRD shrinking (blocked by the rc.443 VDENC error class).

## Follow-up — the spacing guarded only one of two apply paths (field 2026-08-28)

Operator: *"right after the connection it starts very slow (sometimes with a bit
freezes and blurs), but then it stabilizes"*, and one session froze 3-5 s holding the
stale window position mid-drag.

The spacing this FR shipped went into the DEFERRED flush arm only. Its sibling — *"the
scene is quiet, apply now"* — called `set_bitrate` with no gate. **At session start
nothing has moved yet, so that arm is always the one taken**, and every rung the AIMD
crossed climbing to the relay ceiling became a blocking QSV re-open plus a fresh IDR.
Measured on CORPLAP-3, identically at the start of every session:

```
08:27:31  encoder opened  maxrate=2550000
08:27:39  encoder opened  maxrate=2000000
08:27:44  encoder opened  maxrate=3000000
```

with `target_bps` ramping 2.55M → 2.17M → … → 3.0M over ~26 s and a **2 658 ms** viewer
age spike at 07:29:02Z. Steady state either side was 46–60 ms — which is why it
"settles", and why the steady-state field PASS below never caught it.

⚠️ The lesson is structural, not numeric: **the rule was written into one call site
instead of one function.** It is now `encode::rebuild_apply_allowed(constrained,
thrift, since_last, current, target)`, which both paths call — a property of the
ENCODER and the TRANSPORT (this one rebuilds on `set_bitrate`, and the pipe is thin),
not of the arm we happened to arrive through. A third apply path added later inherits
the spacing by calling it rather than by remembering. Same class as the FR-18
`dropped_stale` counter that was incremented and never read.

Shipped in **agent-v0.4.12** (#817). Field gate: at most ONE `ffmpeg encoder opened`
line in the first 15 s of a relay session, and no multi-second age spike at the open.

## Field-verification log

| Release | Result |
|---|---|
| 0.4.5 (relay_idr_thrift) | ✅ FIELD PASS: CORPLAP-3-from-neo16 "very smooth now". CORPLAP-1→CORPLAP-3 session measured post-fix: agent EXONERATED (max inflight 36 KB vs 334 KB pre-fix, send_wait ≤0.38 ms, zero skips, thrift active, no viewer-rate struggle) — the residual "a bit sluggish" there is 98–164 ms DERP RTT with BOTH endpoints corp-VPN d (pair cannot go direct; input-to-photon ≈ 250–350 ms is path physics, out of scope per spec) |
