# peer-relay-port-audit.sh — FR-19 relay-host firewall drift guard.
#
# A peer relay (docs/fr/FR-19-peer-relays.md) forwards ciphertext for other
# tenant nodes over UDP on its relay port (default 3478). If the relay host's
# firewall does not admit that port — OR admits it but a DNAT/redirect steals
# it upstream of the socket — the relay binds a socket and answers nothing:
# `roomler status` reads "bound — NOT yet proven reachable" and every member's
# reachability probe silently fails. This script is the drift guard. It asserts,
# on the relay host itself, that the port is admitted by a rule that NAMES the
# port (SCOPED, not merely a permissive policy) AND that nothing DNATs it away.
# Modelled on the deploy repo's mediasoup-rtc-forwarding.sh.
#
# Usage:
#   peer-relay-port-audit.sh check   [PORT]   # exit 0 iff the port is relay-ready
#   peer-relay-port-audit.sh explain [PORT]   # same, but always prints findings
#
# PORT defaults to 3478. Override via the argument or $PORT.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  a scoped UDP-PORT allow rule is present and nothing DNATs the port
#   1  the port is NOT admitted (closed / no matching rule)          ← drift
#   2  admitted only by a blanket allow-all policy (present, NOT scoped: §884)
#   4  admitted by the filter but a DNAT/redirect CONSUMES it upstream of the
#      socket (e.g. a coturn COTURN_DNAT on 3478 — this is why a cluster node
#      like mars cannot host a relay on 3478 even though 3478 "looks" open)
#   3  no supported firewall backend found (cannot make a determination)
#
# The weekly cron on the build host pushes this over the overlay mesh to each
# relay-serving host and files a GitHub issue when the exit code is non-zero
# (see docs/fr/FR-19-peer-relays.md §Operations). Run it by hand any time.
