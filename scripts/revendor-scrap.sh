# Same invariant as I5 (webrtc-ice) and the wintun-bindings fork: the vendored
# `crates/vendored/scrap` is pristine upstream + ONE canonical patch
# (`crates/vendored/scrap.patch`), so the fork is auditable as a diff rather
# than as a tree nobody can tell apart from upstream.
#
# What the patch does: binds `IOSurfaceGetBytesPerRow` and exposes it as
# `Frame::bytes_per_row()`. Upstream binds only `IOSurfaceGetAllocSize` — the
# page-rounded TOTAL allocation — so a consumer has no way to learn the real
# row pitch and is forced to guess it as `len() / height`. That guess
# overshoots (and is usually not a multiple of 4), which shears every captured
# frame on macOS. Field-hit on a MacBook Pro, 2026-08-23.
