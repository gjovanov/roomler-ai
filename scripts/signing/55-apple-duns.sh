# 55-apple-duns.sh -- get the D-U-N-S number Apple's ORGANIZATION enrolment
# requires, for G ROX LTD.

#
# There is NO public API for any of this -- both the lookup and the request
# are web forms behind an Apple ID sign-in. This script exists to make the
# manual pass a 5-minute copy-paste job instead of a research project, and
# to encode the one insight that usually saves the whole 1-2 week wait:
#
#   LOOK UP FIRST. Dun & Bradstreet auto-creates D-U-N-S records from
#   public business registries. A Bulgarian company that has been in the
#   commercial register since 2018 (UIC 205174895) very likely ALREADY has
#   one -- in which case there is nothing to request, only a number to
#   retrieve, and Apple e-mails it within minutes.
#
# Flow (all via Apple's own channel -- it is free and faster than going to
# dnb.com, and the result lands directly in Apple's enrolment system):
#
#   1. https://developer.apple.com/enroll/duns-lookup/
#      Sign in with the Apple ID that will own the developer account.
#   2. Fill the lookup form with the field sheet below. EXACT legal name --
#      the same character-for-character rule as the Azure validation.
#   3. Outcome A (most likely): "Your organization was found" -- Apple
#      e-mails the D-U-N-S number to the Apple ID address. DONE.
#   4. Outcome B: not found -- the SAME form offers "submit your
#      information to Dun & Bradstreet". Do that (free). D&B assigns a new
#      number in ~5 business days (up to 14); they may phone to verify.
#   5. Either way, once the number arrives: enrol at
#      https://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll/ as an ORGANIZATION
#      (99 USD/yr), then run: ./scripts/signing/60-apple-setup.sh csr
#
# Gotchas encoded from the field:
#   * Enrol as ORGANIZATION, not Individual -- an individual enrolment
#     stamps a personal name on every Developer ID signature, defeating the
#     G ROX LTD identity that Windows publishing already carries.
#   * The D&B record's legal name must match the register: "G ROX LTD".
#     If D&B holds a stale/transliterated name (e.g. "G ROX OOD" or a
#     Cyrillic rendering), request a correction in the same flow BEFORE
#     enrolling -- Apple compares the two and a mismatch stalls enrolment
#     in "additional information required" for weeks.
#   * The person enrolling must have LEGAL AUTHORITY to bind the company.
#     Goran Jovanov is 100% owner + CEO, so select "I am the owner/founder"
#     when asked.
#   * Apple's verification team may call the company phone number on file.
#     Use a number that is actually answered: +359 87 771 1888.
