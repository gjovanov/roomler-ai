.SYNOPSIS
  Reproduce the overlay route-reassertion war (#1328 "Mode A") on demand, so
  the stand-down can be field-verified without waiting for a corp VPN to do it.

.DESCRIPTION
  The guard's stand-down engages on STRIKES, and a strike is "a route we wrote
  is gone again when we look". Only a competitor deleting OUR routes produces
  that. This deletes them, on a timer, exactly as a VPN route monitor does --
  so the daemon cannot tell the difference and the real code path runs.

  It is deliberately NOT a switch inside the daemon. A fault injector whose
  job is to make overlay routes disappear, shipped to a fleet that runs as
  SYSTEM, is one mis-set variable away from taking an operator's remote access
  to their own box -- the exact outcome the overlay's "never self-wedge"
  commitment exists to prevent. An external reaper has the same fidelity and
  none of that blast radius: kill it and the next guard wave heals the host.

.PARAMETER Seconds
  How long to reap. REQUIRED, and capped -- there is no unbounded mode.

.PARAMETER IntervalMs
  Delay between sweeps. Default 700ms: comfortably faster than the guard's
  ~2s wave, so every wave finds its route missing and takes a strike.

.PARAMETER Adapter
  The overlay adapter to reap. Default 'roomler'.

.PARAMETER Family
  IPv4 (peer /32s -- the #1328 Mode A shape) or IPv6 (the ULA). Default IPv4.

.EXAMPLE
  # From another mesh node, on a host running the build under test:
  roomler exec <device> "& 'C:\Program Files\Roomler\scripts\route-war-repro.ps1' -Seconds 180"

.NOTES
  Read the result as a DIFF of two `roomler status` readings, never an
  absolute (the counters are cumulative). The pass signature for #1328 is
  `evicted` flattening while `yielded` climbs. A `yielded` that stays 0 means
  the stand-down never engaged and the run measured nothing -- that is a
  FAILED test, not a quiet one.

  Safety: only ever deletes routes ON THE OVERLAY ADAPTER. It never touches
  another product's rows, so it cannot be mistaken for -- or turn into -- the
  eviction half of the war.
