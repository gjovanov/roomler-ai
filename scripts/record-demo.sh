# The README demo: real machines, one browser tab, each desktop full screen.
#
# Records against whatever server you point it at, usually production: for each
# device in ROOMLER_DEMO_DEVICES it opens the device's remote page with the
# sidebar collapsed, presses Connect, and enters the viewer's fullscreen. Then
# ui/e2e/video/cut-demo.ts cuts the take into the README MP4 and GIF.
#
# What you need before running:
#   - an account that can sign in, and the org (tenant) id the devices are in
#   - each device ONLINE. ROOMLER_DEMO_DEVICES finds it by display name, and
#     ROOMLER_DEMO_LABELS sets the name the video SHOWS: a display name says
#     whose machine it is, so give every device a neutral label
#   - bun, and ffmpeg on PATH (or in WSL)
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/record-demo.sh --login     once: sign in with the credentials below and
#                                        save the session to ~/.roomler-demo-state.json
#                                        (ROOMLER_DEMO_STATE); later takes need no password
#   ROOMLER_DEMO_USER=…  ROOMLER_DEMO_PASS=…  ROOMLER_DEMO_TENANT=<org id> \
#   ROOMLER_DEMO_DEVICES="office-mac,laptop-17,laptop-42" \
#   ROOMLER_DEMO_LABELS="MacBook|Windows laptop|Second laptop" \
#   ROOMLER_DEMO_CAPTIONS="A MacBook — in a browser tab|…|…" \
#   ROOMLER_DEMO_BLUR='[{"device":0,"phase":"full","rect":[136,46,400,394]}]' \
#   ./scripts/record-demo.sh
#
# ROOMLER_DEMO_BLUR (optional) blurs regions of a device's desktop, per layout:
# see cut-demo.ts. Measure the rectangles on the take's own frames.
#
# Optional scenes, each documented where it is defined in record-demo.spec.ts:
#   ROOMLER_DEMO_RECORD / ROOMLER_DEMO_RECORD_PROBE   the viewer's Record button, filmed
#   ROOMLER_DEMO_STEPS                                 scripted input on a remote app
#   ROOMLER_DEMO_NETWORK=1                             the dashboard's Network card
# ROOMLER_DEMO_LOCKCHECK (strongly advised): `roomler exec` selectors to check
# for a signed-in screen right before the take — see below.
# `bun ui/e2e/video/list-demo-devices.ts` lists, from the saved session, the
# orgs and device display names the account can film.
#
# Output, in the take folder (default ~/Videos/Roomler/demo/<date-time>):
#   frames/ + take.json    the raw take: every composited frame, and the marks
#   roomler-demo.mp4       1080p, for linking            → ./roomler-demo.mp4
#   demo-preview.gif       1280 px, auto-plays in README → docs/assets/demo-preview.gif
#   demo-preview-blog.gif  560 px, under the docs build's 3 MiB limit
#                                                        → ui/blog/assets/demo-preview.gif

# ⚠️ The screens are filmed AS THEY ARE, and a machine that is not yours to
# dress can say more than its name. Found on 2026-09-30:
#   - a managed laptop's lock screen printed its hostname, its addresses and
#     where it sits, on every frame (dropped until it was signed in);
#   - an unlocked Mac showed the operator's own dashboard, naming the whole
#     fleet (its window was minimized before the take), then a weather widget
#     naming a place and the host's "being viewed" banner naming the org (both
#     blurred);
#   - a laptop's system tray showed its corporate VPN client's icon (blurred:
#     a product name is a clue to whose network it is).
# A small region such as a tray icon is not text, so no OCR can confirm its
# blur: compare crops of the blurred and the unblurred cut, by eye, in both
# layouts and across the fullscreen switch.
# The take never visits the device list, the dashboard or the network pages,
# but only looking at the frames tells you what the DESKTOPS show. Watch the
# MP4 end to end before publishing either file.
#
# ⚠️ Write the captions from THIS take's frames. The path a machine takes is
# measured, not assumed: a laptop that went through a relay in one take went
# direct an hour later, once its VPN was off. The viewer's stats pills in the
# page frames say which.
