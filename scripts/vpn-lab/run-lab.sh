# This is not hypothetical. Measured 2026-08-25: pc50045 sat **21.4 s behind**
# the dev box, stable across three samples. That skew alone manufactured a
# reading in which the laptop appeared to still be reaching the dev box while
# the dev box's own carrier had gone one-way — an impossible pair of facts that
# cost real time to chase, and which simply vanished once both series were put
# on one clock. Per-END durations were never affected (each is computed inside
# a single host's clock); only the alignment between them was.
#
# NTP is not a fix to rely on here: the corp laptop's clock is managed by a
# domain policy this lab does not control, so the correct move is to MEASURE
# the offset per run rather than assume it away. Half the round-trip bounds the
# error; the RTT is printed so a reader can judge the sample.
