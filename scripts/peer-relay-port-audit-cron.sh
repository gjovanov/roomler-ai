# peer-relay-port-audit-cron.sh — FR-19 weekly relay-firewall drift audit.
#
# Pushes the canonical peer-relay-port-audit.sh to each relay-serving node and
# runs `explain`, then files a GitHub issue on drift. Mirrors the deploy repo's
# mediasoup-rtc-forwarding-audit.sh, but over **Fleet RPC (`roomler exec`)**
# instead of ssh/scp: a relay host such as scw-m2-asahi is a Scaleway box that
# is NOT on the cluster SSH-CA, so the mesh's own control plane is the reach.
#
# Why: the relay port rule is host-local firewall state invisible to ArgoCD and
# the app. When it drifts (closed, or DNAT-stolen — the mars class), the relay
# binds a socket and answers nothing: members fall back to DERP/TURN and the pod
# is never offloaded, silently. This audit is the guard.
#
# Requires: a `roomler` CLI that can reach a permitted-to-originate daemon, and
# `gh`. ⚠️ `roomler exec` needs NO user token — the LOCAL daemon relays it over
# its own server connection (the SERVER authorizes: org kill-switch + the
# originating device's permission + the target's policy + the target's own
# `exec_enabled`). So the only requirement on the cron host is that the CLI can
# reach its daemon's LocalAPI socket (root-owned) and that daemon is permitted to
# originate. LIVE HOME: mars — set `ROOMLER_EXEC="sudo -n roomler exec"` (its
# daemon runs as root, and gjovanov has passwordless sudo + gh + the sibling
# mediasoup cron). Prove the fire path without issue churn: `DRY_RUN=1 PEER_RELAY_PORT=3479`.
#
# Env: PEER_RELAY_PORT (default 3478), PEER_RELAY_AGENTS ("label=agent-id …"),
#      ROOMLER_EXEC (default "roomler exec"; "sudo -n roomler exec" on mars),
#      DRY_RUN=1 (log "WOULD file issue" instead of creating one).
