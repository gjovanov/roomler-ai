# fr-verification-debt.sh — an FR does not close on a merged PR.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
#   `CLAUDE.md` says it in three places and the FR workflow enforces it:
#   **CI green ≠ done.** An FR closes only when its acceptance criteria are
#   FIELD-VERIFIED, and since 2026-09-05 only when its docs exist too. The
#   acceptance criteria in `docs/fr/FR-*.md` are where that verification is
#   recorded — a ticked box is the claim that someone watched the thing work.
#
#   So a CLOSED issue whose spec still carries UNTICKED criteria is one of
#   exactly two things, and both matter:
#
#     1. the work WAS verified and nobody walked back to the checkboxes
#        -> the record is wrong, and the next reader cannot tell which
#     2. the work was NEVER verified and the issue closed on a green lane
#        -> precisely the lie this codebase is built to refuse
#
#   Nothing in this repository could tell those apart, or even notice. The
#   class was measured twice:
#
#     2026-09-01   8 closed FRs carrying 28 unticked criteria
#     2026-09-23  19 closed FRs carrying 74 unticked criteria
#
#   It did not decay. It more than doubled in three weeks, unobserved, while
#   `fr-registry-audit.sh` (the number-collision guard) was green throughout —
#   it audits a different axis entirely, the ledger row against the spec file.
#   This one audits the ISSUE against the spec.
#
#   ⚠️ Among the 74 is FR-73's AC9, the *docs* criterion. "Docs before close"
#      is a standing operator rule, and the one check that could have caught
#      its breach did not exist.
#
# WHY A SEPARATE SCRIPT FROM fr-registry-audit.sh
#
#   That one is hermetic: given a checkout it answers from the tree alone, with
#   no token and no network. It guards FR-number collisions between parallel
#   sessions, which has nothing to do with GitHub being reachable, and folding
#   a network call into it would let an API blip fail the collision guard.
#   This check cannot be hermetic — issue state lives on GitHub and nowhere
#   else — so it is its own script and its own CI job.
#
# THE BASELINE IS A PAIR, NOT A RATCHET
#
#   Borrowed from `name-audit.sh`, which learned it the hard way: a pure
#   "must not increase" ratchet happily passes a PR that pays off one FR's
#   debt and closes another FR with the same number of unticked criteria. The
#   total is unchanged and the guard says OK.
#
#   So each FR is pinned EXACTLY, in both directions:
#
#     count > pinned   -> new debt (criteria unticked, or an FR closed with them)
#     count < pinned   -> debt paid; lower the pin so the floor tracks the tree
#     pinned but open  -> stale entry; the FR reopened
#     pinned, no debt  -> stale entry
#     debt, not pinned -> new debt
#
#   Every entry in the baseline costs a reviewed line that SAYS WHY that FR
#   closed with criteria unticked. That is the whole point: the debt does not
#   become invisible, it becomes attributable. FR-29's entry, for instance,
#   records a criterion its own spec declares "NOT met — and not addressable
#   by P1" — honest, deliberate, and now written down where a guard can see it.
#
# A SECOND CHECK: THE DOCS CRITERION ITSELF
#
#   The operator's rule (PR #1401, 2026-09-05): closing an FR requires its docs,
#   and the docs step is "a phase row AND an acceptance criterion in every
#   spec". The check above can only enforce a criterion that EXISTS — it counts
#   boxes, so a spec that never wrote the docs criterion looks exactly like one
#   whose docs are done. FR-81 was the live case: all 8 criteria ticked, a clean
#   Result, reported as a close candidate — and no docs page, no docs/README.md
#   row, no docs criterion. Its AC8 says "documented in a skill", and that skill
#   is gitignored, so nothing public documents it at all.
#
#   Measured when this was written: 11 of 81 specs carry the criterion, and 37
#   of 41 open FRs lack it. But a rule binds from when it was made, so an FR is
#   BOUND by it if its issue OPENED, or it CLOSED, after the rule reached
#   master. Bound and lacking the criterion: exactly four — FR-74 and FR-81
#   (written after the rule), FR-7 and FR-66 (closed after it). Of the 9 specs
#   written since the rule, 7 carry it.
#
#   The 35 open FRs written BEFORE the rule are reported, not failed: each
#   becomes bound the day it closes, and a close without the criterion fails
#   then. Together the two checks make docs-before-close enforceable at all —
#   this one makes the docs criterion exist, the first makes it ticked.
#
#   ⚠️ Phase rows are NOT checked, although the rule names them. `autopilot`
#      measured 15+ distinct phase-table shapes and prose in place of a table,
#      and records that nothing may depend on parsing them.
#
# USAGE
#   bash scripts/fr-verification-debt.sh                   # CI guard; non-zero on drift
#   bash scripts/fr-verification-debt.sh --summary         # report only, always exit 0
#   bash scripts/fr-verification-debt.sh --update-baseline # after debt is paid or accepted
#
# ⚠️ Deliberately NO `set -o pipefail`, for the reason `fr-registry-audit.sh`
#    records: FR-46's audit died exactly there. `grep` with no match exits 1,
#    and under `pipefail` that killed the script AT THE MOMENT IT SUCCEEDED —
#    empty stdout, empty stderr, a clean tree indistinguishable from a crash.
#    Here "no matches" is the HEALTHY answer for most of these searches.

set -eu

# ⚠️ MEASURED, not precautionary. `docs/fr/README.md` is prose — em-dashes,
#    emoji, and at least one stray `0xA8` that is not valid UTF-8 on its own.
#    In a UTF-8 locale a `sed` `.*` STOPS at that byte rather than running to
#    end of line, so a substitution that looks like it consumed the row left
#    the tail behind and the captured issue number came back as `788<0xA8>`.
#    The lookup then silently missed and eight closed FRs were reported as
#    "issue could not be resolved" instead of as debt — a guard under-reporting
#    while looking healthy, which is the failure this file exists to prevent.
#    Under `LC_ALL=C` every tool treats the file as bytes and `.` matches any
#    of them. The parsers below additionally never match against the prose
#    columns at all, so neither defence relies on the other.

# ── acceptance criteria, scoped to the section that holds them ───────────────
# Counting every checkbox in the file would sweep in phase tables and open
# decisions. The section is well defined: all 81 specs carry exactly one
# `##`-level heading whose text contains "acceptance criteria", in eight
# spellings ("## Acceptance criteria", "## 8. Acceptance criteria",
# "## Acceptance criteria (all field-verified)", …), and it runs to the next
# `##`. `###` sub-headings do NOT end it — several specs group criteria under
# them, and treating those as the end would silently undercount.
#
# The same pass answers the second question: does the section contain THE docs
# criterion? Two traps, both measured on these 81 specs:
#
#   ⚠️ Criteria are MULTI-LINE. FR-72's and FR-75's index-row commitment sits
#      on a continuation line, so reading only the checkbox line misses them.
#      Each criterion is joined with its indented continuation lines first.
#   ⚠️ Many FEATURE criteria mention a doc — "docs/self-hosting.md states it"
#      (FR-42), "no longer say amd64-only" (FR-57). Those are about the feature,
#      not about documenting it; a matcher on the word "docs" ANYWHERE counts
#      them.
#   ⚠️ …but the index row is not a complete signal either, and that was found
#      the day this shipped. FR-83's criterion — "Docs: `docs/roomler-ssh.md`
#      shows the ack in the grant sequence" — updates a doc that is ALREADY
#      indexed, so it has no reason to mention docs/README.md; nor does it name
#      the rule. The guard failed CI naming FR-83 as a breach of the rule it had
#      followed. A matcher calibrated on 81 specs met a legitimate 82nd phrasing.
#
#   So a criterion is the docs criterion when ANY of three holds:
#     1. its SUBJECT is the docs step — the first line, with the checkbox, the
#        bold/italic markers and an `ACn`/`Pn` id stripped, opens with the WORD
#        "docs" ("Docs updated…", "**Docs** —", "AC9 — Docs:"). A feature
#        criterion opens with something else, or with a `docs/` PATH whose
#        content it asserts — excluded by "docs" not followed by "/";
#     2. it commits to the docs/README.md index row (the rule's own words);
#     3. it names the rule outright (FR-23: its deliverable IS documentation).
#   Measured on the 82 specs: (1) adds exactly FR-83 to what (2)+(3) found, and
#   matches none of the feature criteria above.
#   `docs/fr/README.md` — the ledger — does not match (2): there "docs/" is
#   followed by "fr/".
#
# Prints "<ticked> <unticked> <has_docs_criterion 0|1>".
