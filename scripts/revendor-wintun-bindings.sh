# rc.283 (same invariant as I5 for webrtc-ice) — the vendored
# `crates/vendored/wintun-bindings` is pristine upstream + ONE canonical patch
# (`crates/vendored/wintun-bindings.patch`: the on-drop NetworkList
# Profiles/Signatures registry deletion removed, so an adapter drop no longer
# erases the roomler network's NLA identity / Private-profile categorization).
# This script makes that relationship mechanical:
#
#   scripts/revendor-wintun-bindings.sh [version]           rebuild the vendored tree
#                                                           from upstream + patch
#                                                           (use on a tun bump)
#   scripts/revendor-wintun-bindings.sh --check [version]   verify tree == upstream+patch
#                                                           (CI drift gate; no writes)
#   scripts/revendor-wintun-bindings.sh --regen [version]   regenerate the .patch from
#                                                           the CURRENT vendored tree
#                                                           (after editing the fork)

# Default version: 0.7.39 (the release `tun` 0.8.10 resolves). After a
# rebuild, run `cargo check -p roomler-ai-tunnel-core --features overlay-l3`
# ON WINDOWS — the crate is windows-target-only, so a Linux CI build never
# compiles it; the drift gate below is content comparison and runs anywhere.
