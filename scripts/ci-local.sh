# Run the Linux-runnable subset of CI's cargo gates, locally, with HONEST
# exit statuses.
#
# Why this exists (2026-08-23): a hand-rolled
# `cargo check --workspace --all-targets … | grep ': error'` reported CLEAN on
# a tree that did not compile, twice. Two separate reasons, and both are the
# kind you cannot fix by being careful:
#
#   1. The workspace includes the Tauri tray, whose `libdbus-sys` build script
#      PANICS when libdbus-1-dev is absent. cargo aborts before reaching the
#      crates you changed, a build-script panic is not a `path:line: error`
#      line, so the grep matches nothing — and the pipe throws away cargo's
#      exit status. You get silence and read it as success.
#   2. Several gates are FEATURE-GATED (`overlay-l3`, `overlay-netstack`,
#      `ssh-server`, `vp9-444`). A default `-p` check never compiles that code
#      at all, so a struct literal in a feature-gated test helper sails past
#      every local check and fails in CI.
#
# The rules this encodes: branch on the COMMAND'S EXIT STATUS, never on
# grepped output; and run the same feature combinations CI runs.
#
# Usage:  bash scripts/ci-local.sh [--quick]
#           --quick   skip the slower feature-gated lanes
#
# Prerequisites (matching CI's apt step):
#   sudo apt install -y libdbus-1-dev libglib2.0-dev libgtk-3-dev \
#       libsoup-3.0-dev libjavascriptcoregtk-4.1-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev \
#       pkg-config
# Without libdbus-1-dev the workspace lanes fail for an ENVIRONMENTAL reason —
# this script says so explicitly rather than letting it look like your bug.
#
# NOT covered here, deliberately:
#   * `vp9-444` (needs libvpx + bindgen), macOS lanes, Windows lanes.
#   * `cargo test -p roomler-ai-tests` — needs MongoDB + Redis. CI does not run
#     it either; see docs and CLAUDE.md for the WSL+docker recipe.

# Per-CHECKOUT log dir. Parallel sessions each run this from their own

# A local check you cannot trust is worse than no local check — that is the
# whole reason this script exists — so the path is keyed to the checkout.
