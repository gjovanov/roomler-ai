#!/usr/bin/env bash
# FR-41 (#965) — dress a roomlerd virtual desktop so a demo recording has
# something worth filming, instead of two small windows on black.
#
# Run as root on the agent host, AFTER the daemon is up with
# ROOMLERD_VIRTUAL_DESKTOP=1:
#
#   sudo bash scripts/demo-desktop.sh
#
# Four things this had to learn the hard way, all of them non-obvious:
#
# 1. ⚠️ WSLg exports WAYLAND_DISPLAY into every environment, and GTK PREFERS
#    Wayland when it sees it. So GTK apps started with DISPLAY=:<n> still tried
#    to talk to WSLg's compositor and died with
#    "libwnck ... no valid display found" — pointing at the wrong display
#    entirely. Unsetting WAYLAND_DISPLAY and pinning GDK_BACKEND=x11 is what
#    makes them land on the Xvfb the agent is actually capturing.
#
# 2. ⚠️ Do NOT swap the window manager under a live capture. `xfwm4 --replace`
#    against the Xvfb wedged the X server outright — xwd and xwininfo stopped
#    answering and the desktop had to be rebuilt. openbox (what the daemon
#    starts) is known to work with capture; dress around it.
#
# 3. ⚠️ xfce4-panel and xfdesktop want a session manager that does not exist
#    here ("Failed to connect to the session manager"), so they are not an
#    option. A wallpaper plus well-chosen windows gets most of the way.
#
# 4. ⚠️ The daemon picks the next FREE display each start, so it walks
#    (:100 -> :101 -> :102 ...) across restarts and leaves stale
#    /tmp/.X<n>-lock behind. Never hardcode the display — discover it.

# ⚠️ Reap apps left on a PREVIOUS display first. Because the daemon walks the

# the script worked. Staleness is per-display, so the only safe test is "did we
# start it on THIS one".
