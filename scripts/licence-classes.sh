# Single source of truth for the licence split (FR-24).
#
# Every other consumer — scripts/apply-spdx.sh, the licensing CI workflow, the
# `license` field audit — sources this file. The point is that changing the
# server licence later (to FSL-1.1-ALv2 or BUSL-1.1, say) is editing ONE line
# here plus the licence text file, not a sweep through the tree.
#
# The classification below is derived from the workspace dependency graph, not
# from intuition about what a crate is "for". The rule that produced it:
#
#   A crate compiled into BOTH the server and a shipped agent binary must take
#   the CLIENT licence. Otherwise the agent inherits the server's copyleft, and
#   an AGPL binary on a customer endpoint is a procurement blocker.
#
# That is why tunnel-core / remote_control / localapi / tcp-turn-conn are MPL
# despite `crates/api` linking all four. See LICENSING.md.
