"""Generate the desktop companion's and the setup wizard's icons from the
product's brand mark.

Why this exists: the icons shipped as 1x1 PLACEHOLDERS (67-byte PNGs). Windows
tolerated them; macOS did not — `tao`'s tray setup panics before the app
window ever appears:

    invalid icon: The specified dimensions (1x1) don't match the number of
    pixels supplied by the `rgba` argument (0)

and a panic in that callback "cannot unwind", so the process aborts. The
companion could not start on macOS at all. The setup wizard carried the same
1x1 placeholders for its whole life (its build.rs still writes them when the
files are missing), so the one EXE a new user double-clicks had a blank icon
in Explorer and the taskbar — FR-84 S2 gave it a real one.

Generated rather than hand-drawn so the mark stays in step with
`ui/public/favicon.svg` (a #1565C0 rounded square with a white R) and so
regenerating is a command rather than an afternoon in a paint program.

    python3 scripts/gen-tray-icons.py                   # the companion (default)
    python3 scripts/gen-tray-icons.py --target setup    # the setup wizard

Requires Pillow. `desktop` writes agents/roomler-desktop/icons/ (app icon,
menu-bar template, the tray while a recording runs, .ico). `setup` writes
agents/roomler-setup/icons/ — the same R on GREEN (#2E7D32), so a wizard and
a companion side by side in a taskbar are told apart at a glance; app icon +
.ico only, the wizard has no tray. CI asserts both sets are real (ci.yml
"Assert the icons are real").
