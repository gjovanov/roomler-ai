#
# WHAT IT FETCHES
#   DB-IP's "IP to Country Lite" in MaxMind DB format: this month's release, or
#   last month's. DB-IP publishes a month on its 1st (06:27 UTC for 2026-09), so
#   for the first hours of every month the current name answers 404. Older
#   releases stay downloadable for a few months.
#     https://download.db-ip.com/free/dbip-country-lite-YYYY-MM.mmdb.gz
#   It lands as dbip-country-lite.mmdb, the path the image's
#   ROOMLER__STATS__GEOIP_MMDB names, with dbip-country-lite.provenance.txt
#   beside it: the release, URL, SHA-256, licence and credit.
#
# WHY THIS DATABASE
#   The image is a PUBLIC package. DB-IP licenses its Lite databases under
#   CC BY 4.0, which permits redistributing them with attribution
#   (db-ip.com/db/download/ip-to-country-lite):
#     "You are free to use this IP to Country Lite database in your
#      application, provided you give attribution to DB-IP.com for the data.
#      In the case of a web application, you must include a link back to
#      DB-IP.com on pages that display or use results from the database."
#   The observability dashboard carries that link. MaxMind's GeoLite2 cannot go
#   into a public image: its EULA (§6) forbids disclosing GeoLite data to any
#   third party without MaxMind's prior written consent.
#
# WHAT IT CHECKS
#   The download comes over TLS from DB-IP's own host. Then: a valid gzip stream
#   (its CRC catches a truncated or corrupted transfer), a size between 1 MiB and
#   128 MiB (the 2026-10 release is 8.3 MB, an HTML error page is a few KB, and
#   anything city-sized is not the country database), and MaxMind DB metadata
#   that names the type DBIP-Country-Lite.
#   It does NOT pin a checksum. A pin would need a commit every month, and the
#   sums DB-IP lists come from the same origin as the file, so they prove no
#   more than the gzip CRC does. It RECORDS the SHA-256 of what it staged, in
#   the provenance file and in the log. The deep check belongs to the server:
#   the image smoke boots it and requires "geoip database loaded".
#
# A MISSING DATABASE IS A SUPPORTED STATE
#   Every failure here (DB-IP unreachable, a release not yet published, a file
#   that is not what it claims) stages NOTHING and exits 0 with a warning. A
#   database an earlier run staged is kept. Without one the image reports
#   `country: unknown` and `geoip: false`, as designed: a build must never
#   fail because a third party's download did.
#
# Exit 0 = staged, or warned and skipped. Exit 2 = usage error.
# Under GitHub Actions it also sets step outputs: present=true|false,
# release=YYYY-MM (or "kept"), sha256=<hex>.
#
# GEOIP_BASE_URL overrides https://download.db-ip.com/free (an https mirror,
# or a way to exercise the failure path).
