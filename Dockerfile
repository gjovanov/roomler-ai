# --- Stage 1: Rust build ---
#
# FR-73 P1b — three layers instead of one, so a registry-backed cache is worth
# something on Actions (where every runner starts empty):
#
#   chef     the toolchain + cargo-chef, keyed by nothing that changes per commit
#   planner  the dependency recipe, keyed by the manifests
#   builder  `cargo chef cook` = every dependency (the mediasoup C++ worker
#            included) as ONE layer keyed by that recipe, then the real build
#            over ONLY the Rust sources
#
# Before this the stage was `COPY . .` then `cargo build`: any change anywhere —
# a UI file, a doc — invalidated the build layer and paid the full cold build
# (17 min 35 s measured on Actions, FR-69 AC4), and inside that layer rustup
# ALSO downloaded the toolchain `rust-toolchain.toml` pins, because the base
# image was a different minor. The base now matches the pin, so nothing is
# fetched at build time.
#
# ⚠️ `cook` must receive exactly the arguments the real build does (`-p`,
# `--no-default-features`, `--features`): a different feature set compiles the
# dependencies twice, which is slower than no cache — silently.

# FR-69 P8 (D9/D13) — which pillars this image carries. `full` | `collab` |
# `remote` | `mesh` | `access`; every profile is the same server composed from
# fewer modules, and `/health` lists the ones it mounts. `SAAS=1` adds the
# hosted service's billing + newsletter module: the default HERE so the
# operator's manual prod build (no build args) keeps it; the self-host publish
# workflow passes `SAAS=0` and asserts the image does not mount it.

# The `[patch.crates-io]` crates (`rtp`, `webrtc-ice`, `webrtc`) and the
# other path dependencies under crates/vendored are NOT part of the recipe —
# cargo-chef skeletonises workspace members, and a patch is resolved by
# cargo from its real manifest at cook time (the first dry run died with
# "failed to read /app/crates/vendored/rtp/Cargo.toml"). They ARE
# dependencies, so they belong in this layer: a change to a vendored crate
# invalidates the cook, which is the correct key.
COPY crates/vendored crates/vendored
# `derp-relay` rides along so the SAME image can run as the central
# coturn workers' `/stats` sidecar (stats follow-up): one image, two
# binaries, no second build+push pipeline. A few MB, and it keeps the
# stats producer byte-identical between the PoPs and the central fleet.
# Package-qualified features are what let one build line serve both
# packages: `derp-relay` has no features, so `--no-default-features` is
# inert for it, and `roomler-ai-api/profile-…` names exactly the one crate
# that composes the modules.
#
# `cook --no-build` writes the skeleton (every workspace member reduced to
# its manifest + an empty source file) and stops. The build is then ours,
# because ONE member has to be real while the dependencies compile: the
# vendored `webrtc-ice` patch (a real crate, not a skeleton) depends on
# `crates/tcp-turn-conn`, and against the skeleton it fails with
# "cannot find `TcpTurnConn` in `tcp_turn_conn`" (the second dry run). So
# that member is overlaid with its real sources before the dependency build.
# Afterwards every member's artefacts are removed, which is what `cook`
# itself does after building: the real sources arrive by COPY with the
# build context's OLDER mtimes, and cargo would otherwise keep the skeleton's
# empty artefacts as "fresh" — a server whose main() is `{}`.
