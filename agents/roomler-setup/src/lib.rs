//! Roomler Setup — lib surface of the unified wizard.
//!
//! The wizard's binary entry point lives in `src/main.rs`; everything
//! else (Tauri invoke handlers, the two install orchestrators, proxy
//! resolution, role mapping) lives here so unit tests can execute
//! without spawning the Tauri webview EXE (which would require
//! elevation on Windows when run from a non-admin shell).
//!
//! One app, four roles (see [`role::Role`]): the three daemon roles
//! drive the MSI pipeline relocated from `agents/roomler-installer`
//! ([`orchestrator_agent`]); the tunnel-client role drives the
//! archive pipeline relocated from `agents/roomler-tunnel-installer`
//! ([`orchestrator_tunnel`]). Mechanics (asset resolver, MSI runner,
//! extract, integration, enroll HTTP, unified ProgressEvent) come
//! from `wizard_shared` (`crates/roomler-setup-core`); the agent- and
//! tunnel-coupled calls stay here.
