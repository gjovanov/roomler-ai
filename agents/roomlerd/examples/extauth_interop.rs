//! FR-52 — the DEVICE half of a cross-implementation OPAQUE login, driven over
//! stdin/stdout so a real browser-side client can log into it.
//!
//! This exists because the one decision in FR-52 that is expensive to get wrong
//! is whether a browser can log into a device at all. The ciphersuite, the KSF
//! parameters and the message encoding are all compatibility surfaces: once a
//! device stores a record, changing any of them is a forced password reset on
//! every device in the field. A Rust-to-Rust test cannot catch a mismatch with
//! the browser library, because both halves share whatever this crate got wrong.
//!
//! It registers a password exactly as `roomler rc password set` does
//! ([`set_password`]), then answers ONE login:
//!
//! ```text
//!   stdin : KE1 (base64url, no padding)      stdout: KE2
//!   stdin : KE3                              stdout: OK <sha256(session key)> | FAIL <reason>
//! ```
//!
//! The encoding is `@serenity-kit/opaque`'s (base64url, no padding), so its
//! output is fed in unmodified. Only a HASH of the session key is printed —
//! equal hashes on both sides prove the keys agree without printing either.
//!
//! Run (the password comes from the environment, never argv):
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo build -p roomlerd --features external-access --example extauth_interop
//! EXTAUTH_PW=… <js client that spawns target/debug/examples/extauth_interop>
//! ```
