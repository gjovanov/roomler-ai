//! FR-90 decision 15 — on a Mac, whether a session's account may use `sudo`
//! without a password.
//!
//! A session holds none of its account's administrator groups (decision 13),
//! and on Linux `no_new_privs` keeps it from `sudo` altogether. macOS has no
//! such switch, and its `sudo` reads the account's groups from the directory,
//! never from the process: field-measured with `%admin … NOPASSWD` as the only
//! passwordless rule, a session without the admin group still got root
//! (FR-90 §8). So an account with any passwordless rule, by user or by group,
//! would hand its sessions root there. A start as one is refused
//! (`passwordless_sudo`) unless the device's owner allows it
//! (`hive_allow_passwordless_sudo`, never pushable).
//!
//! ⚠️ Asked AS ROOT, `sudo -l -U <account>`, never as the account. Listing
//! another account's rules authenticates nobody. Asking as the account
//! (`sudo -n -l`) would fail on every Mac whose `sudo` asks for a password,
//! which is every Mac nobody changed, and have PAM try to authenticate the
//! account at every start, in the unified log (field-measured, FR-90 §8).
