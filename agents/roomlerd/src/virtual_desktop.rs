//
// The failure this fixes: on a host running a virtual desktop, `roomler
// restart` took 96 s and the CLI reported failure at 60 s though the restart
// worked. The daemon runs under systemd `KillMode=control-group`,
// `TimeoutStopSec=90s`; once the daemon exits, systemd must empty the unit's
// cgroup, and the desktop's `at-spi-bus-launcher` — a setsid'd grandchild that
// ignores SIGTERM — kept the cgroup non-empty until systemd SIGKILLed it 90 s
// later, then paid `RestartSec` on top.
//
// So the daemon takes its own desktop down before it leaves. Two facts shape
// how:
//
//   * The children are spawned into a dedicated process GROUP ([`start`]), so
//     `killpg` reaches every one that stayed in it — but a grandchild that
//     called `setsid` (at-spi, a D-Bus service) has left the group.
//   * `setsid` changes the session and the group, never the PARENT, so a
//     descendant is still reachable by walking `/proc` parent links down from
//     our direct children. We snapshot `/proc` BEFORE signalling anything, so
//     the links are still intact (nothing has been reparented to init yet).
//
// The union of the two — group members and the parent-link closure of our
// children — is every process the daemon spawned for the desktop, and nothing
// else. SIGTERM, a short grace, then SIGKILL for the SIGTERM-deaf remainder.

/// The desktop's process group and the direct children we spawned, recorded
/// when [`start`] succeeds so [`teardown`] can run without the
/// [`VirtualDesktop`] handle — the graceful exit paths (`exit_for_requested_restart`,
/// the SIGTERM arm of `run_cmd`) reach it as a free function.
