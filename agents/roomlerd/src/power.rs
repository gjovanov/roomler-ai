//! FR-55 — keep the device reachable instead of letting it quietly sleep.
//!
//! A device that sleeps is a device that is offline, and until this module there
//! was nothing in the product with any opinion about power at all:
//! `IOPMAssertion`, `SetThreadExecutionState`, `PowerCreateRequest` and
//! `systemd-inhibit` had zero occurrences across the tree.
//!
//! Measured on the operator's MacBook (2026-09-01): the idle timer is **one
//! minute** (`pmset -g`: `sleep 1`), and it really sleeps on AC —
//! `Entering Sleep state due to 'Idle Sleep'` and `'Clamshell Sleep'`.
//!
//! ## Two rules, and the first is not a policy
//!
//! 1. **An active session always holds the machine awake.** A remote-desktop or
//!    SSH session must not be cut by an idle timer, and that is true whatever
//!    the standing policy says. ⚠️ Today this happens on macOS only BY
//!    ACCIDENT: injecting input tickles `IOHIDSystem`, which registers as user
//!    activity. So a session where someone is *typing* is protected and a
//!    **view-only** one is not — and watching a long build is exactly the case
//!    that most wants to stay up.
//! 2. **Everything else is opt-in, default off.** A remote-access tool that
//!    silently drains a laptop battery earns the reputation it gets, so
//!    [`PowerPolicy`] is device-owned with the same last-word rule as
//!    `exec_enabled` and `ssh_enabled` (`docs/remote-config.md`).
//!
//! ## What this cannot do
//!
//! ⚠️ **macOS clamshell sleep ignores idle-sleep assertions** on a laptop with
//! no external display. Closing the lid puts the machine to sleep no matter
//! what we hold. That is an OS limit, not a bug here, and the UI that offers
//! the policy has to say so — otherwise the feature looks broken to exactly the
//! person who enabled it.
//!
//! ⚠️ Nothing here wakes a machine that is already asleep. That needs a magic
//! packet from a peer on the same L2 (FR-55 P5); `womp` is already enabled on
//! the MacBook and the overlay already knows which peers share a LAN.
