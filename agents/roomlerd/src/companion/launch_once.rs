//! FR-84 D6 — open the desktop companion ONCE after a fresh install.
//!
//! Every install path ends with the daemon starting (the MSI's service
//! start, `install.ps1`'s restart, the wizard, `install.sh`'s `systemctl
//! enable --now`), so the daemon is the one place that covers them all. What
//! it must never do is the opposite failure: resurrect a companion a person
//! quit. So the launch is guarded by a MARKER in the daemon's own data dir —
//! written BEFORE the spawn, and never again once written — and by a
//! fresh-install test (`last_known_good_version` is unset until a daemon has
//! run healthily for five minutes, so an UPGRADED install is adopted, not
//! launched into).
//!
//! This module holds the decision (pure, table-tested) and the marker
//! handling; `super::launch_once_after_install` drives it with real facts.
//!
//! macOS compiles the decision but never drives it — the `.pkg`'s LaunchAgent
//! already opens the companion after install and at login — hence the
//! dead-code allowance there and only there.
