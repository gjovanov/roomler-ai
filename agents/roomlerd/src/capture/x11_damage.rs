//! FR-29 P1 — "did anything change?" for the X11 capture path.
//!
//! `scrap` on Linux is XShm, and `Capturer::frame()` performs a full-screen
//! `GetImage` on every call. Unlike Windows DXGI Desktop Duplication — which
//! answers `WouldBlock` when the desktop is unchanged — XShm has no
//! "nothing changed" signal at all, so an idle desktop pays the full readback
//! at the target frame rate forever. Measured on a 1080p Fedora Asahi host:
//! ~20 ms per frame and ~50 % of a CPU core to transmit a static screen.
//!
//! The pump already knows what to do with "no frame": `peer.rs` logs
//! `capture produced no frame (idle screen)` when `next_frame` yields `None`.
//! This module exists purely to make that existing path *reachable* on Linux
//! by answering the question XShm cannot.
//!
//! It runs on its own X11 connection (scrap owns its own and does not expose
//! it) and is created on the capture worker thread, which is where the whole
//! backend is already pinned for XShm thread-affinity reasons.
