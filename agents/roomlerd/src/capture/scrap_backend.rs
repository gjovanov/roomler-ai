//! Cross-platform screen capture backed by the `scrap` crate.
//!
//! `scrap` is a thin wrapper that picks the right kernel primitive per OS:
//!   - Linux  → XShm (X11 shared-memory pixmap)
//!   - Windows → DXGI Desktop Duplication
//!   - macOS  → CoreGraphics `CGDisplayStream` fallback
//!
//! `scrap::Capturer` is `!Send` (XShm handles have thread affinity), so we
//! pin it to a dedicated OS thread and drive it via oneshot commands: the
//! async `next_frame` sends a oneshot sender, the worker captures, fills
//! the oneshot. That keeps the async runtime free while respecting the
//! underlying thread-affinity requirement.
//!
//! BGRA is always emitted (scrap's native format); the encoder layer is
//! responsible for any colour conversion.
