//! FR-45 P4, daemon side — the seam between the input arbiter and the portal
//! helper's stdin.
//!
//! While a portal capture with granted input is live, injected events belong
//! to the portal session, not to the OS injector: on the hosts this backend
//! exists for, enigo's XTest reaches nothing and uinput's events have no
//! reader (FR-45 field log). [`super::backend::PortalCapture`] registers a
//! sender here when its helper announces input; the arbiter's single
//! injection funnel consults [`try_route`] per event.
//!
//! ## Why a per-event check and not a backend choice
//!
//! The arbiter creates ONE process-wide injector, lazily, at the first
//! injected event — and the portal capture opens around the same moment, from
//! another task. Deciding "portal or OS" once at injector creation would race
//! that startup and freeze the loser in place for the life of the process.
//! A per-event lookup costs a mutex and makes the answer always current:
//! capture restarts, session ends, kill switch — the route follows.
//!
//! ## One desktop, so one active route — with correct handoff
//!
//! Every portal helper injects into the SAME physical desktop (one seat0
//! session per host), and the arbiter already arbitrates which session may
//! inject. So all arbitrated input should reach ONE portal helper. The
//! registry is therefore an ORDERED list of the live helpers, and [`try_route`]
//! always targets the OLDEST surviving one:
//!
//! - Registration APPENDS; it never overwrites. A second concurrent viewer's
//!   capture cannot silently steal the route from the first — the earlier
//!   finding where viewer B's `register` clobbered viewer A's slot and B's
//!   teardown then set it to `None`, leaving A falling through to the
//!   do-nothing OS injector, input-dead mid-session.
//! - The active target changes ONLY when the current owner's capture drops,
//!   which happens as that session ends. Because closing a portal session
//!   releases its own virtual devices, a key held via the departing helper is
//!   released by the compositor; a stale release routed to the new owner's
//!   helper lands on the same physical desktop and is a harmless no-op there.
//!   So a held modifier is never stranded — the route-steal stuck-key finding.
//! - Within one session the active target is STABLE for the session's whole
//!   life, so a key-down and its later up always reach the same helper.
//!
//! ⚠️ The one residual: concurrent multi-viewer portal input all funnels
//! through the oldest helper's RemoteDesktop session. On one physical desktop
//! that is correct (whoever holds the floor injects into the one screen), and
//! it is far better than the alternative of clobbering or splitting. If a
//! future host ever presents two independent portal desktops in one daemon,
//! this needs per-desktop routing — but no such host exists today.
