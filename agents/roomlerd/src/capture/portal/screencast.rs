//! FR-45 P2b — open a ScreenCast session through the desktop portal.
//! FR-45 P4 — or a **RemoteDesktop** session, which is a ScreenCast session
//! that can also inject input.
//!
//! [P2a](super::helper) established that the daemon can *reach* the portal, by
//! running a helper inside the console user's session. This is what that helper
//! goes on to do: the four-step handshake, ending with a PipeWire node id and a
//! connection fd.
//!
//! ## The Request/Response pattern, and the one way to get it wrong
//!
//! Portal methods do not return their result. They return the object path of a
//! `Request`, and the answer arrives later as a `Response` **signal** on that
//! path — because a portal call can take as long as a human takes to read a
//! dialog.
//!
//! ⚠️ The subscription must be armed **before** the method is called. The
//! request path is derivable in advance (that is why `handle_token` exists),
//! and arming afterwards is a race the portal wins whenever it answers without
//! asking anyone — exactly the restore-token case this phase depends on.
//!
//! ## How input changes the handshake (P4) — and how it deliberately doesn't
//!
//! A RemoteDesktop session is not a second session next to the capture one: it
//! is the SAME session, created and started through the RemoteDesktop
//! interface instead, with `SelectDevices` slotted in before the unchanged
//! `SelectSources`. One session means one consent dialog covering both "see"
//! and "touch", one restore token, and one PipeWire stream — the shape
//! gnome-remote-desktop uses. `Start` and `CreateSession` move to the
//! interface that owns the session; `SelectSources` and `OpenPipeWireRemote`
//! stay on ScreenCast, addressed at the shared session path.
//!
//! ⚠️ Persistence moves with ownership: an input session persists through
//! `SelectDevices.persist_mode` (RemoteDesktop v2+), NOT through
//! `SelectSources` — the portal ignores ScreenCast persistence options on a
//! remote desktop session. And the two grants are stored apart
//! ([`TokenStore`]): a capture-only token cannot restore an input session,
//! and quietly widening a stored "see" grant into "see and touch" without a
//! dialog is exactly what must not happen.
//!
//! ## 🔑 The PipeWire fd stays HERE
//!
//! The FR-45 plan originally had this phase pass the fd back to the daemon
//! over `SCM_RIGHTS`, inherited from FR-36's design, while also saying P3 would
//! consume PipeWire *inside the helper*. Those cannot both be true, so the
//! question got decided here rather than left to P3:
//!
//! **The helper consumes PipeWire; the fd never crosses to the daemon.**
//!
//! 1. *Fault isolation.* This project already paid for putting third-party
//!    driver code in the daemon's address space: a vendor probe that faulted
//!    took `roomlerd` down and the service manager restarted it straight back
//!    into the same fault — a crash-loop, not a degraded agent (`encode::caps`
//!    is a child process for that reason). `libpipewire` loads SPA plugins and
//!    sits on the same vendor GPU stacks. A fault there should cost capture,
//!    not the daemon.
//!  2. *It is not the slower choice.* PipeWire negotiates a small **pool** of
//!    buffers (dmabuf or memfd). Those fds cross once, at negotiation; per
//!    frame only "buffer N is ready" flows. Frames crossing a process boundary
//!    does not mean pixels being copied.
//! 3. *The helper already runs as the session's user*, whose PipeWire this is.
//!
//! So `SCM_RIGHTS` still appears in FR-45, but in P3 and carrying **buffer**
//! fds — not here carrying the connection.
