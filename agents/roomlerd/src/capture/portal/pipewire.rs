//! FR-45 P3a — reach PipeWire without linking it.
//!
//! [P2b](super::screencast) ends with a PipeWire node id and a connection fd
//! the portal handed us. This is the step that uses that fd — and the step the
//! whole FR has been shaped around, because *how* we reach `libpipewire`
//! decides whether the daemon still starts on hosts that will never run a
//! portal.
//!
//! ## Why `dlopen`, spelled out once
//!
//! Linking `libpipewire` puts it in `roomlerd`'s `DT_NEEDED` on **every** Linux
//! build. A missing `.so` there does not degrade a feature — the loader refuses
//! to start the process at all. Cluster nodes, containers and headless fleet
//! hosts would carry it for nothing and break if it went missing. This project
//! has already paid for that once, when vendored FFmpeg dylibs baked a Homebrew
//! path into the macOS agent and dyld killed it at launch on every end-user
//! Mac.
//!
//! ⚠️ **A helper subcommand does not fix this.** `roomlerd portal-helper` is the
//! same ELF as `roomlerd`; linking for the helper's sake links for everyone.
//! The subcommand bought the *session context* (P2a); only `dlopen` buys the
//! *linkage*. It would have been easy to reach here believing P2a settled it.
//!
//! So: resolved at runtime, and every failure is a status this backend reports
//! rather than a condition anything else has to survive.
//!
//! ## What this phase does and does not prove
//!
//! It loads the library, initialises PipeWire, builds a context, and connects
//! **the portal's fd** to it. A successful connect means the socket was
//! accepted and a core proxy exists — the fd is real and usable.
//!
//! ⚠️ It does **not** prove frames flow. Format negotiation (SPA PODs) and
//! buffer delivery are P3b, and claiming otherwise from a non-null pointer
//! would be exactly the kind of unfalsifiable "it works" this FR keeps
//! rejecting.
//!
//! ## Dependencies added: none
//!
//! `libc` was already in the graph. There is no `pipewire` crate here on
//! purpose — adding one would link the library and undo the whole point.
