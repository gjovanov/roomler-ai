//! Daemon-originated tunnel-**client** flows (unification P3b-2 PR-C).
//!
//! Lets the roomler daemon act as a tunnel *client* — `roomler forward` /
//! `roomler socks5` over the LocalAPI — by driving
//! [`tunnel_core::driver::run_tunnel_session`] over the daemon's **existing
//! agent WebSocket** (agent JWT, `Principal::Agent` server-side) instead of a
//! second `TunnelClient` identity + second WS. The server half (accepting an
//! agent-WS as a tunnel originator) shipped in PR-B2; this is the consumer.
//!
//! ## Multiplexing N flows over one WS
//!
//! The daemon runs many client sessions over its ONE agent WS, so it needs to
//! demux the server's replies. Two seams make that work:
//!
//! * **egress** — every session's [`DaemonSink`] funnels its `ClientMsg`s onto
//!   the SAME `outbound_tx` the signaling loop drains onto the WS. The sink
//!   stamps this session's **`open_nonce`** onto the `TunnelOpen` (the driver
//!   hardcodes `None` — a single-session CLI matches the reply positionally; we
//!   can't).
//! * **ingress** — [`intercept_server_msg`] (called from the signaling loop's
//!   read arm, mirroring `overlay::intercept`) routes each client-bound
//!   `ServerMsg` into its session's per-session [`ChannelSource`]: pre-`opened`
//!   by `open_nonce`, post-`opened` by `session_id`. Everything else passes
//!   through to the target-side `handle_server_msg`.
//!
//! The demux maps + the flow registry live in [`TunnelClientHub`], created once
//! in `run_cmd` and shared (it's `Clone` over an `Arc`) between the signaling
//! loop (publish the live sink + intercept) and `DaemonState` (the LocalAPI
//! create/kill/flows verbs) — so flows survive WS reconnects.
//!
//! ## The flow owns its listener (FR-86 P1)
//!
//! A flow binds `127.0.0.1:<local>` **once**, when its supervisor starts, and
//! keeps it for its whole life ([`tunnel_core::flow_listener::FlowListener`]).
//! Each session the ladder establishes is a [`Carrier`] installed behind that
//! listener; when the carrier dies the listener stays bound and holds new
//! connections (bounded: [`HoldPolicy`]) until the next carrier is ready,
//! instead of the kernel refusing them for the whole re-establishment. Before
//! this the session bound the port itself, which also made it impossible to
//! establish a second session beside the first — P2's make-before-break
//! re-upgrade needs exactly that.
