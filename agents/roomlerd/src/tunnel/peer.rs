//! Agent-side answerer for the `roomler` WebRTC handshake.
//!
//! Mirror of `roomler-cli`'s offerer-side [`TunnelPeer`] usage —
//! same crate type, just the answerer half of the handshake. One
//! `AgentTunnelPeer` per active tunnel session (server-issued
//! `tunnel_session_id`).
//!
//! Lifecycle:
//!
//! 1. Server emits `ServerMsg::TunnelSdpOffer { session_id, sdp }`.
//!    Agent's signaling loop calls
//!    [`AgentTunnelPeer::accept_offer`] which constructs the peer,
//!    installs the ICE-candidate forwarder, sets remote-describe,
//!    generates the answer, and returns it for the caller to ship
//!    as `ClientMsg::TunnelSdpAnswer`.
//! 2. Server trickles ICE via `ServerMsg::TunnelIce`. Agent calls
//!    [`AgentTunnelPeer::add_remote_ice`] for each.
//! 3. The DC pool opens (both ends pre-negotiated identical stream
//!    ids). A background task `await`s
//!    [`tunnel_core::transport::webrtc_dc::TunnelPeer::wait_pool_open`],
//!    then installs a [`FlowDemux`] on each DC and parks them in the
//!    `flow_demuxes` field so the acceptor can register per-flow
//!    mailboxes.
//! 4. Server emits `ServerMsg::TcpForwardForward` for each new flow.
//!    `crate::tunnel::acceptor::handle_forward_request` consults the
//!    ACL, dials dst, calls [`AgentTunnelPeer::register_flow`] to
//!    bind the flow to a DC, and spawns
//!    `tunnel_core::forward::run_flow` to drive the bytes.
//! 5. Either side tears down the tunnel via `TunnelTerminate` →
//!    [`AgentTunnelPeer::close`] drops every flow + DC.
//! 6. Or the client is simply gone (#1754): the peer reports it on the
//!    org loop's [`super::reap`] channel — a pool DC's `on_close` within
//!    milliseconds of a clean remote close, the peer connection's
//!    `Failed` ~30 s into silence — and the loop's reap arm removes and
//!    closes it exactly as a terminate would have.
