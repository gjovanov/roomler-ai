//! FR-79 V3b / FR-74 — ONE belief about what the path carries.
//!
//! # Three symptoms, one defect
//!
//! Measured on the fleet across 2026-09-09/10, on three different hosts and
//! two different carriers:
//!
//! 1. **The gate cannot fire on a relay.** CORPLAP-3 ran a whole session with
//!    `goodput_bps=None` and `goodput_samples=(0, 5)` — five windows of blocked
//!    time, every one under `goodput::MIN_WINDOW_BLOCKED`, nothing accepted. So
//!    FR-79 V5's rule ("a stall while sending above the measured pipe is our
//!    fault") had no measurement to compare against and was inert on that host.
//! 2. **The ceiling sawtooths on a direct path.** Regal-Elena-PZ, 1920×1080
//!    HEVC over a direct carrier at 6–11 ms paint age: the ceiling is a
//!    bits-per-pixel CONSTANT (0.625 bpp = 38,880,000), the blocked-send
//!    goodput measured **6,028,814**, and the target oscillated between them
//!    with a two-to-three minute period for the life of the session — 4.5
//!    minutes to first reach the ceiling, then collapse to ~5.3 M, climb,
//!    collapse to ~6.1 M. Every collapse is a visible softening.
//! 3. **The rate memory has almost nothing to remember.** CORPLAP-2 accepted
//!    exactly ONE sample per session in two very different link conditions.
//!
//! Those are one defect: **there is no trustworthy, always-available estimate
//! of what the path carries.** Every loop that needs one either invents a
//! constant (FR-74's bpp ceiling), goes silent (FR-79's gate), or remembers a
//! number nobody measured (the pair memory).
//!
//! # What this type fixes, and it is a distinction the old code did not make
//!
//! Two different things were being averaged together by `pipe_bps`'s
//! `min(goodput, link_rx)`:
//!
//! - **A demonstrated floor** — *"this path carried at least X."* Available
//!   from EVERY window on EVERY carrier, because the viewer reports its
//!   arrival rate whether or not anything is congested. It needs no
//!   congestion, and it is a hard lower bound: those bytes actually arrived.
//! - **A capacity estimate** — *"this path carries about X."* Only available
//!   when the path pushed back: a blocked send, or the viewer's arrival rate
//!   while its queue is growing. It is an estimate of the LIMIT.
//!
//! Taking `min` of the two is wrong in the direction that hurts: an arrival
//! rate measured while the sender was idle is not a capacity, and a
//! blocked-send sample taken during one burst is not a reason to disbelieve a
//! delivery that already happened. Symptom 2 is exactly that error — the
//! collapse target was a 6 Mbps capacity sample on a path that had just
//! delivered far more.
//!
//! So: a floor is never allowed to lower the anchor, and the anchor is never
//! `None` once anything has been delivered.
//!
//! ⚠️ The floor is a MAX, not an average. An average of delivered rates
//! measures the CONTENT (an idle desktop sends ~300 kbps through a gigabit
//! path); only the peak says anything about the path.
//!
//! # ⚠️⚠️ What a quiet screen proves: nothing. The overnight shadow, 83 samples
//!
//! The first version expired the floor after 30 s, so that "a path which
//! genuinely degraded is not pinned to its old peak". 300 sweeps across the
//! fleet showed that reasoning is wrong, because it cannot tell a degraded path
//! from a still screen. Direct sessions spanned **11 kbps to 24.7 Mbps**, median
//! 270 kbps — and the extremes are the SAME HOSTS:
//!
//! ```text
//! CORPLAP-3  19:46-20:02  s=6aa307be  belief = 4.8 - 8.4 Mbps    (content moving)
//! CORPLAP-3  13:25-13:54  s=6aa3d669  belief = 12.8 kbps         (static screen)
//!                                     tgt=34,560,000  n=(10696, 0)
//! CORPLAP-2  19:39        s=6aa30771  belief = 24.7 Mbps
//! CORPLAP-1  07:40-07:44  s=6aa3aff5  belief = 10.3 - 10.8 Mbps
//! ```
//!
//! A host that demonstrated 8.4 Mbps read **13 kbps** hours later with nobody
//! typing, and the floor kept expiring to `None` entirely between reports. Had
//! FR-74 P5 anchored a ceiling on that, a still screen would have collapsed the
//! ceiling to the legibility floor and STARVED the next burst — making the
//! symptom this whole arc exists to fix strictly worse.
//!
//! So the rule is evidential, not temporal: **a delivery raises the floor and
//! nothing but contrary evidence lowers it.** A capacity sample below the floor
//! is that contrary evidence — the path got smaller, and the old demonstration
//! stops being true. Time is not evidence. Quiet is not evidence.
//!
//! ⚠️ The cost, accepted knowingly: a path that silently degrades keeps an
//! optimistic floor until something pushes back. That is the right trade,
//! because the floor only ever feeds a CEILING — a bound saying "you may try" —
//! and the capacity path cuts the moment trying fails. An optimistic bound
//! costs one burst; a pessimistic one costs every burst.
//!
//! # ⚠️⚠️ The two questions are NOT interchangeable, and the API says so
//!
//! There is deliberately no single `believed_bps()`. The first shadow session
//! showed why, within minutes of shipping — CORPLAP-1 on `relay:derp/tcp`,
//! `0.4.98`, an idle desktop:
//!
//! ```text
//! goodput_bps=None  goodput_samples=(0, 0)
//! pipe_belief=(Some(1802656), Some(1802656), None)   pipe_belief_n=(35, 0)
//! target_bps=3000000   viewer_age_ms=Some(59)
//! ```
//!
//! 35 deliveries, ZERO capacity samples, nothing congested, paint age 59 ms —
//! a perfectly healthy session. A rule that read `1,802,656` as "the pipe"
//! would have computed `3.0 M > 1.2 × 1.8 M` and concluded the session was
//! overdriving. It was not: 1.8 Mbps is what an idle desktop WEIGHS, and the
//! path was never asked for more.
//!
//! So each consumer must name its question:
//!
//! | question | accessor | `None` means |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | *"am I sending more than this path will take?"* (FR-79 V5) | [`Pipe::capacity_bps`] | no push-back ⇒ **no claim to contradict** ⇒ do not cut |
//! | *"what may the ceiling be?"* (FR-74 P5) | [`Pipe::ceiling_anchor_bps`] | nothing measured ⇒ fall back to the bpp bound |
//! | *"what has this path already proven?"* | [`Pipe::floor_bps`] | — |
//!
//! A floor is a LOWER BOUND. It says the path carried at least X. It never
//! says the path would refuse X + 1, and no amount of idle delivery makes it
//! say that.
