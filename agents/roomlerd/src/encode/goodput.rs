//! Measured-rate v2 — estimate what the session is ACTUALLY delivering,
//! and (stage 1) derive the bitrate ceiling from it.
//!
//! ## Why
//!
//! Every constrained-path decision keys off a NOMINAL relay clamp
//! (3 Mbps) and a boolean `constrained`, and the DIRECT path had no
//! absolute anchor at all: sessions (re)open at the resolution-derived
//! ceiling (15 Mbps at 2880×1800) while the pipe drains ~10, and the
//! whole mismatch lands as send-queue lag + production skips (field
//! 2026-08-26, neo16↔Rozalina — the "sluggish, then chunky" drag).
//! The AIMD only observes send-channel occupancy, so it rediscovers the
//! pipe by congesting it on every burst.
//!
//! ## The one hard problem: a fast sample is not evidence
//!
//! Handing a frame to SCTP is not the same as delivering it. When the
//! socket buffer has headroom a frame serialises in microseconds, which
//! computes to an absurd throughput that says nothing about the pipe —
//! it is a LOWER BOUND ("at least this fast"), not a measurement.
//!
//! Stage 0 answered this with busy-period bracketing (only measure an
//! unbroken ≥300 ms stretch where the queue never dried), which turned
//! out to be structurally unsatisfiable on the sessions that need it:
//! at 40 fps a ~30 KB frame drains in ~24 ms — just under the ~25 ms
//! inter-arrival — so the queue momentarily dries between frames even
//! while the CUMULATIVE deficit grows. Field heartbeats read
//! `goodput_samples: "(0, N)"` all session.
//!
//! v2 keeps the philosophy and fixes the granularity: the send task
//! times each frame's chunked `dc.send()` serialisation. A frame whose
//! serialisation took at least [`MIN_BLOCKED_SEND`] was flow-controlled
//! by SCTP for its whole transit — its bytes-over-time IS the drain
//! rate during that window. Sub-threshold sends are buffer headroom and
//! are DISCARDED at the source, so no amount of idle traffic can bias
//! the estimate upward. The governor then folds one WINDOW at a time
//! (its existing 1 s cadence): the window's samples are aggregated
//! byte-weighted (Σbytes / Σelapsed) and the aggregate must carry at
//! least [`MIN_WINDOW_BLOCKED`] of genuinely-blocked time to count —
//! one lone borderline frame is not a window's worth of evidence.
//!
//! Consequences worth knowing:
//!
//! - On an idle/unbound link nothing qualifies, the estimate stays
//!   `None`, and every derived quantity falls back to the nominal band.
//! - Any sustained overrun (a drag burst, relay congestion) produces a
//!   steady stream of qualifying samples within its first seconds.
//!
//! ## Asymmetric adaptation
//!
//! Down fast, up slow. A VPN throttling mid-session is something to
//! believe immediately; one lucky burst is not evidence the pipe grew.
//! The estimate also decays to `None` after [`CONFIDENCE_TTL`] without a
//! qualifying window, so a stale number can never outlive the conditions
//! that produced it — silence reverts to the nominal band rather than
//! pinning whatever was last true.
//!
//! ## Stage 1 — consumption
//!
//! [`derived_ceiling_bps`] turns the estimate into a bitrate ceiling:
//! `0.85 × G`, floored at 1 Mbps (insurance against a pathological
//! sample bricking video — the EWMA recovers in 2-3 windows anyway).
//! The governor applies `ceiling := min(nominal, derived)` — the
//! measurement may only ever LOWER the clamp, because the nominal clamp
//! also protects the TURN path. Kill switch:
//! `ROOMLERD_MEASURED_CEILING=0` / config `measured_ceiling`.
