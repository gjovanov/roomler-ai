//! P8c — the rate governor: ONE owner for the four rate controllers
//! the DC pumps previously threaded by hand.
//!
//! The encode inventory (P8 plan, 2026-08-20) found four control loops
//! that discover each other by accident inside the pump bodies:
//!
//! 1. **AIMD bitrate** (`aimd::AimdController`) — driven off
//!    send-channel occupancy at three different loop positions
//!    (capacity gate, pre-encode, try_send overflow).
//! 2. **Viewer-rate fps cap** (`viewer_rate::ViewerRateController`) —
//!    1 s windows folding the browser's decode report into a
//!    frame-skip divisor.
//! 3. **Encode pressure** (`encode_pressure::EncodePressure`) — the
//!    `encode_factor` maxrate scale, stepped once per 2 s heartbeat.
//! 4. **Auto-downscale tier** (`encode_pressure::DownscaleTier`) —
//!    the soft resolution cap when the bitrate lever is exhausted.
//!
//! This module changes NO behavior. The four controllers are owned
//! unchanged; every method here is a 1:1 relocation of a pump touch
//! point, so the pump calls the governor at exactly the positions it
//! previously mutated controller state — same order, same inputs,
//! same rate limits. What it buys structurally:
//!
//! - every cross-loop input is a **named parameter** (`send_depth` at
//!   construction, `send_capacity`, `ceiling_bps`, the decode report,
//!   `avg_encode_ms`) instead of ambient pump locals;
//! - `last_applied_bitrate` has ONE owner (the `applied_bps` mirror)
//!   instead of a per-pump local that each touch point must remember
//!   to update;
//! - the declared invariants at the bottom are tests, not tribal
//!   knowledge (divisor can't starve the refine signal; the skip gate
//!   never sheds a forced keyframe; the 1 s window gate holds).
//!
//! Behavioral unification (shared clock, merged MD signals) is a
//! LATER, separate decision once this soaks — deliberately not here.
