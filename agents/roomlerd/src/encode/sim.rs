//! FR-63 B0 — a deterministic simulator for the remote-desktop rate laws.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! Every rate decision this codebase makes has been verified by opening a
//! session on somebody's laptop and reading a heartbeat. That works, and it
//! found real bugs, but it has two properties that keep costing us releases:
//!
//! 1. **The interesting cells are the ones we cannot summon.** FR-63's AC0b —
//!    "the opener's ramp removes the harm" — was blocked for a day because no
//!    reachable host could produce a pipe thin enough for the *baseline arm to
//!    fail*. Three cells were tried; each was genuinely constrained and none
//!    over-drove, because a 2.55 Mbps opener into a relay carrying ~3 Mbps is
//!    not an over-drive. The field case that motivated the whole phase was
//!    ~213 kbps, and nothing agent-side manufactures that.
//! 2. **A field run is not repeatable.** The pipe, the content and the encoder
//!    all move between arms, so a difference is never attributable with
//!    confidence to the one flag under test.
//!
//! A simulator fixes both, at the cost of being a *model*. So the rule for
//! reading anything this module prints:
//!
//! ⚠️ **A simulator result is evidence about the LAW, not about the fleet.** It
//! can prove that a rate law over-drives a 213 kbps token bucket; it cannot
//! prove that a corporate VPN behaves like a token bucket. Field verification
//! is not replaced by this — it is *aimed* by it. Acceptance criteria that say
//! "field-verified" still mean field-verified.
//!
//! # What is modelled, and what is not
//!
//! The harness drives the **shipped laws directly** — [`SlowStart`] and
//! [`AimdController`] are the real types, in the real order `governor.rs`
//! calls them (`set_floor` then `set_ceiling` then `observe`; one ramp verdict
//! per viewer window). Nothing here re-implements a law, so a fixture that
//! passes is a statement about production code rather than about a copy of it.
//!
//! Modelled: a token-bucket link with an RTT, a finite buffer, seeded loss and
//! scheduled stalls; the bounded send channel the AIMD actually observes
//! (occupancy and full-ness); CBR frame production with a keyframe multiplier;
//! and a viewer folding arrivals into `decodestat`-shaped windows (age, p95
//! age, `rx_bps`, `queue_ms` by the same Σ(Δarrival − Δwire) the browser's
//! `rc-hop-stats.ts` uses).
//!
//! NOT modelled, deliberately: the encoder's rate-following error (FR-62's
//! subject — here the encoder hits its target exactly, so a fixture failure is
//! never an encoder artefact), packet-level SCTP behaviour, the ICE ladder,
//! and anything about *pixels*. The send channel and the SCTP buffer are
//! collapsed into one queue, because they are in series and the slow end
//! governs; the AIMD's view of that queue is what it sees in production.
//!
//! # Test-only
//!
//! `#[cfg(test)]`, so this ships zero bytes. It builds on the DEFAULT feature
//! set — no FFmpeg, no capture backends — because `cargo test -p roomlerd
//! --lib` is the lane that runs it, and that lane compiles none of the pump.
