//! FR-35 — the constrained ceiling learns the pair.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! A relayed session runs under a fleet constant, `relay_max_bps` (3 Mbps),
//! opened at 85 % of it. Measured on the real `neo16 → CORPLAP-2` DERP path
//! (2026-08-29): that pair sustains ~6–9 Mbps and absorbs short bursts far
//! above; at a 25.5 Mbps cap the whole desktop landed as one 680 KB frame at
//! +0.3 s, while at the constant it is a 5.6 KB max-QP keyframe repaired by
//! inter frames over ~1.2 s. Other corp relays in the same fleet measured
//! ~2 Mbps. A constant cannot be right for both — and on NVENC every rate
//! change *down* forces a starved keyframe (FR-31), so within a session the
//! cap may only ever climb.
//!
//! # The rule
//!
//! The AIMD (`aimd.rs`) climbs additively inside a ceiling the pump hands it
//! every tick. This learner sits between the plan ceiling and the AIMD and
//! lifts that ceiling — above the nominal, up to `hi` — only on **delivery
//! evidence** collected once per viewer window (1 s):
//!
//! - the AIMD is *pinned* at the current ceiling (it wants more),
//! - the window actually *carried* ≥ 70 % of that ceiling (a quiet desktop
//!   sending 900 kbps is not evidence about an 8 Mbps cap — the parked
//!   measured-rate line's lesson: you cannot measure capacity you are not
//!   using),
//! - no decrease and no send stall in the trailing 10 s (the send channel
//!   filling, a blocked send, or viewer-age excess all mean the *pipe* is
//!   the limiter, not the cap),
//! - the viewer's paint age, when reported, sits within 1.5× its learned
//!   floor.
//!
//! Any decrease pulls the learned ceiling back to the post-decrease target
//! (never below the nominal), so an over-estimate is corrected by the same
//! signals that would have caught a bad constant. A blocked send longer than
//! [`HARD_STALL`] is answered with a ×0.5 cut instead of the AIMD's ×0.85 —
//! the 7.9 s stall in the P0 measurement was met by three ×0.85 steps over
//! four seconds.
//!
//! The session's *stable rate* — the highest target that held [`STABLE_HOLD`]
//! without a decrease — is what `rate_memory` persists per peer, so the next
//! session on the pair opens at [`SEED_PCT`] of it instead of at the constant.
//!
//! Pure: no clocks, no I/O, no encoder types; every method takes `now`.
