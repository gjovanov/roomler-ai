//! Viewer-reported sustainable-rate controller for the DataChannel video pumps.
//!
//! Replaces the rc.184 keyframe-request-*rate* `DecodePressure` heuristic. That
//! design inferred viewer distress from how OFTEN the browser sent `rc:keyframe`
//! resync requests — but the browser debounces those to ~4/s (250 ms) while the
//! shed needed ≥4/s to escalate, so the two never coordinated: on a weak viewer
//! (Iris Xe) the agent kept firehosing 60 fps, the viewer's WebCodecs decode
//! queue backed up, it dropped deltas + asked for a (heavy) IDR, which was even
//! HARDER to decode → the periodic 1-2 s freeze the field reported on dragging a
//! window. An RTX-5090 viewer of the SAME host never stuttered — pure
//! viewer-decode binding, not capture/encode.
//!
//! Now the VIEWER measures its own decoded fps + whether it dropped frames to a
//! backlog this window and sends `{fps, struggling}` over the control DC
//! (`rc:decodestat`). This controller folds that DIRECT, measured signal into an
//! fps cap. When struggling, it clamps the cap to just below what the viewer
//! actually sustained, so the agent immediately sends fewer frames; after a run
//! of clean windows it probes the cap lazily back toward the capture rate (so a
//! transient dip recovers, but a viewer sitting just under its ceiling doesn't
//! oscillate).
//!
//! The pump converts the cap into the existing frame-skip divisor
//! (`ceil(capture_fps / cap_fps)`, keyframes never skipped), so the agent
//! SETTLES at the viewer's real sustainable fps. During a sustained window-drag
//! the viewer struggles every window → the cap holds → smooth reduced fps;
//! motion stops → it recovers. Because the divisor quantises (caps 31..60 all
//! map to 30 fps until the cap reaches capture_fps exactly), active use naturally
//! parks at the reduced rate and only climbs back to full fps after a long idle.
//!
//! Pure (no webrtc / capture / ffmpeg types) → unit-tests on the default
//! `cargo test --lib`. The pump features are what USE it, hence the dead_code
//! allow on the signalling-only build (mirrors `aimd` / `encode_pressure`).
