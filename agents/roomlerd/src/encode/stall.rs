//! FR-65 P0 — the pump stall watch's VERDICT, as a pure function.
//!
//! # Why this is a module and not four lines in the pump
//!
//! The decision "was this iteration a stall, and where did its time go" is the
//! instrument the whole FR turns on, and it had two properties that made it
//! impossible to check:
//!
//! 1. It lived inline in `media_pump_ffmpeg_dc`, which is behind the
//!    `ffmpeg-encoder` feature — **not** a default feature, so
//!    `cargo test -p roomlerd --lib` compiled none of it. The rule that
//!    decides whether an operator ever sees a stall was, in the lane everyone
//!    runs, unreachable.
//! 2. Its two subtractions are each a judgement that was *paid for in the
//!    field* (see below), and both are easy to "simplify" into something that
//!    looks equivalent and is not.
//!
//! Extracting it costs one struct and buys a test that runs on every push.
//!
//! # The two rules, and what each cost to learn
//!
//! **`work_us = iter − capture`, and the stall decision runs on THAT.** Capture
//! is change-driven, so a quiet screen sleeps *inside* capture and `capture_us`
//! accumulates the wait. At the original 250 ms bar those passes were invisible;
//! at the 100 ms bar they became the MAJORITY of warnings — field 2026-09-03, a
//! direct session logged seven in 45 s, every one shaped
//! `iter_ms=111 capture_ms=101.9`: 9 ms of work and 102 ms of idling. A watch
//! that cries about idling is one people learn to ignore, which costs exactly
//! the signal it exists for. The waiting is genuine: every capture backend hands
//! the device work to a thread that owns the `!Send` capturer and returns a
//! future, so the loop is idling by design.
//!
//! ⚠️ **The cost of that rule, stated so nobody rediscovers it as a bug:** a
//! pathological capture — a wedged DXGI duplication, an EDR filter stalling the
//! desktop, a driver hang — **cannot trip this watch**, and `pump_stalls`
//! under-counts by construction. `capture_us` is still reported, so a reader can
//! see it, but nothing ALERTS on it. If capture needs an alarm it needs its own
//! threshold, not this one widened back.
//!
//! **`other_us = iter − Σphases`, computed rather than left to a reader.** An
//! overrun whose named phases all read ~0 is itself the finding: the time went
//! somewhere still untimed. Field 2026-09-03: four stalls on CORPLAP-1, one on
//! the first pass of every session, `iter_ms` 513–1006 while the named phases
//! summed to 33–52 ms — 0.46–0.96 s in no phase at all. That was the initial
//! encoder open, and it hid for months behind a breakdown that *looked*
//! complete; it was spotted by eye on the fourth occurrence. A breakdown that
//! does not sum to its total is the most useful number in the line, so it must
//! not depend on somebody noticing.

/// One pump iteration's phase breakdown, in microseconds.
///
/// Every field is a DELTA for this pass (the pump keeps running accumulators
/// and subtracts the previous pass's marks), so the invariant a reader should
/// expect is `Σ phases ≤ iter_us` — and where it does not hold,
/// [`PassTiming::other_us`] is the gap that says so.
