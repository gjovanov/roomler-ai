//! FR-43 P2a — the daemon side of the GUI-worker delegation channel.
//!
//! macOS forces two processes (a root LaunchDaemon has no WindowServer; a
//! GUI-session process cannot create a `utun`) but not two enrollments. The
//! daemon holds the enrollment and the worker holds the screen, so an rc
//! session has to cross between them. This module owns the crossing.
//!
//! **P2a is the channel only.** It carries the handshake and liveness; the nine
//! rc-session payloads land in P2b. The channel ships on its own because it is
//! the invasive half — an exception to LocalAPI's request/response invariant
//! (`localapi::Request::RcAttach`) — and an exception deserves to be proven
//! before anything is built on top of it.
//!
//! ## Why a secret, when every other verb trusts the socket
//!
//! For every other LocalAPI verb the 0600 socket **is** the authorisation: a
//! caller that can open it is the owning user or root, and the verbs are things
//! that user is entitled to do. Attaching is not like that. The legitimate
//! worker is an ordinary process in the user's session — and so is an
//! attacker's. Without a secret, any process in that session could volunteer to
//! serve the device's remote-control sessions: to be the thing that sees the
//! screen and receives the keystrokes.
//!
//! So the daemon mints a fresh secret for each worker it spawns and hands it
//! over **on the worker's stdin**. It is never written to disk, never in argv,
//! and never leaves the host.
//!
//! ⚠️ Two obvious alternatives were measured on a real Mac and rejected, and
//! both failures are silent, which is why they were measured rather than
//! assumed:
//!
//! - **the environment** — `sudo` in the spawn chain runs under the stock
//!   `Defaults env_reset` and discards it. This is not hypothetical: P1's
//!   `ROOMLER_MACOS_SUPERVISED` marker went out this way and never reached a
//!   single worker, unnoticed because nothing read it yet.
//! - **an inherited socketpair**, where possession of the fd would BE the
//!   authorisation — strictly better, but `sudo` closes inherited descriptors
//!   too. Recorded under "Dead hypotheses" in the FR, including that
//!   `launchctl asuser` alone preserves them, so it returns if the chain ever
//!   drops `sudo`.
//!
//! ## Default-deny, three ways
//!
//! 1. No secret issued means refuse. That is the state whenever the supervisor
//!    is off or launchd owns the worker, so "the feature is disabled" is not a
//!    separate code path — it is the absence of a secret.
//! 2. One attached worker at a time. A second attach is refused rather than
//!    displacing the first, because displacement is a denial-of-service
//!    primitive for any local process that guesses right.
//! 3. The secret is revoked when the worker stops, so a worker the supervisor
//!    has already released cannot come back.
