//! FR-27 — the live remote-control session registry.
//!
//! "Who is watching my screen, and how do I stop them" existed only inside the
//! Windows-native overlay: the daemon knew, but nothing else could ask. There
//! was no LocalAPI verb for a live session, so the desktop companion could not
//! render a banner on any platform and no thin client could offer a Disconnect.
//!
//! This is the shared handle that fixes that. One instance per daemon, created
//! in `run_cmd` and given to BOTH the LocalAPI's `DaemonState` (which reads it)
//! and every signalling loop's [`crate::indicator::ViewerIndicator`] (which
//! writes it, at the same two call sites that already raise and clear the
//! on-screen indicator — so a session cannot appear in one and not the other).
//!
//! ⚠️ Each entry carries its OWN loop's kill channel, not a process-global one.
//! A multi-org daemon runs one signalling loop per enrollment, and a session
//! belongs to exactly one of them; a single shared sender would have to guess.
