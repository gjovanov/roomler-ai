//! FR-43 P1 — the root daemon as supervisor of the GUI-session worker.
//!
//! macOS is the one platform where one process cannot serve both planes: a
//! root LaunchDaemon lives in session 0 with no WindowServer, so it can never
//! capture or inject; a GUI-session process is the console user, so it can
//! never create a `utun`. Windows escapes this because a SYSTEM process can
//! attach to the interactive desktop (`win_service/desktop.rs`); macOS has no
//! such API. Two processes are therefore forced — but two *enrollments* are
//! not, and this module is the first step of collapsing them (FR-43).
//!
//! P0 measured the mechanism on real hardware (2026-08-30, issue #971): from
//! the running root daemon, a capture in session 0 fails with "could not
//! create image from display", while the same call through
//! `launchctl asuser <console-uid>` produced an 8.4 MB screenshot in 233 ms —
//! and our own binary spawned that way reports both a live GUI session and its
//! TCC grants. So `launchctl asuser` is the launchd analogue of the Windows
//! supervisor's `WTSQueryUserToken` + `CreateProcessAsUserW`
//! (`win_service/supervisor.rs::spawn_in_session`), and this is the launchd
//! analogue of its `decide_spawn`.
//!
//! ## What P1 deliberately does NOT do
//!
//! It never fights launchd. If the LaunchAgent job is loaded in `gui/<uid>`,
//! **launchd owns the worker and this supervisor stands down** — because both
//! spawning would put two processes on ONE enrollment, and the hub displaces
//! the older control WS (`remote_control/src/hub.rs`), producing a
//! login/displace/relaunch loop that looks exactly like a flapping device.
//! That stand-down is what makes flipping the switch on a live Mac a no-op,
//! and it is why P1 can ship before the packaging change that stops
//! bootstrapping the LaunchAgent (P3).
//!
//! Kill switch: `macos_supervise_gui_worker`, default **off**. Off, this
//! module does nothing at all and the two halves behave byte-for-byte as they
//! do today.
