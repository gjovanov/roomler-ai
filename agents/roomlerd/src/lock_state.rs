//! Lock-screen detection for the user-context worker (M3 Z-path).
//!
//! Background. The M5 verification on the field-test host + operator confirmed
//! the field gap: when the user presses Win+L (or Windows otherwise
//! switches the input desktop to `winsta0\Winlogon`), the user-
//! context agent worker stays alive — `WTSGetActiveConsoleSessionId`
//! doesn't change, the SCM supervisor's `decide_spawn` returns
//! `KeepCurrent`, the WS connection stays connected, the WebRTC
//! peer stays connected — but capture frames go black/stale because
//! the worker's desktop attachment (`winsta0\Default`) is no longer
//! visible, and input injection is silently dropped because
//! `SendInput` targets the wrong desktop.
//!
//! M3's Z-path closes this in the simplest possible way: detect the
//! lock transition from the user-context worker, paint a static
//! "Host is locked" overlay frame to the encoder until unlock, and
//! suppress input injection. No SYSTEM-context capture+input thread,
//! no IPC, no remote-unlock — just a dignified "we're paused"
//! signal so the operator doesn't see a frozen desktop and assume
//! the agent crashed.
//!
//! Detection mechanism. We poll `OpenInputDesktop` every 500 ms from
//! the user-context worker. Because the worker runs in the user's
//! security context — *not* SYSTEM — the call returns:
//!   - `Ok(Some(_))` with desktop name `"Default"` when the user is
//!     on their normal interactive desktop
//!   - `Ok(None)` (`ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED`) when the input desktop has
//!     transitioned to `winsta0\Winlogon` (the lock screen, UAC
//!     consent, or a service-launched secure prompt)
//!   - `Ok(Some(_))` with a different desktop name in unusual cases
//!     (Citrix / RDP custom desktops); we treat anything that isn't
//!     `Default` as "not visible to me" → locked from our POV.
//!
//! 500 ms is a calm cadence. The actual desktop transition takes
//! ~250 ms on Win11, so the worst case the user sees is one half-
//! second of "frozen" frames before the overlay kicks in. Could be
//! tightened to 250 ms if field reports show that's user-visible,
//! but a full second of poll-loop CPU work × N agents × forever is
//! not free.
//!
//! Why not `WTSRegisterSessionNotification`? It fires on
//! `WTS_SESSION_LOCK` / `WTS_SESSION_UNLOCK` exactly when we want,
//! but requires a top-level window owned by the calling process to
//! receive the WM_WTSSESSION_CHANGE message — the agent worker is
//! a console app with no message pump, so plumbing that in adds
//! more code than the polling loop saves. Polling is also more
//! robust to the "user opened a UAC prompt" case which doesn't
//! fire WTS_SESSION_LOCK but DOES switch the input desktop.
