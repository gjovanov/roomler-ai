//! FR-84 D3 — who supervises this daemon process, decided once at startup from
//! evidence the supervisor itself left behind, never from the config file; and
//! the decision that rests on it, whether `Request::RestartDaemon` ("Apply
//! now") may go ahead.
//!
//! The mechanism of that verb is "exit, and let the supervisor relaunch me",
//! and that is only a restart if something *will* relaunch the process. An
//! orphan `roomlerd run` — a hand-started process, a pre-rc.435 root daemon, a
//! container's PID 1 — that exits on request is not restarted; it is **taken
//! offline**, by the person who pressed a button expecting the opposite
//! (`docs/remote-config.md` §7b). So the default answer is
//! [`Supervision::None`], and every other variant has to be earned by a signal
//! only that supervisor produces:
//!
//! | variant | evidence | who relaunches, and on what |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `WindowsScm` | the SCM host spawns its workers as `run --supervisor scm` (`win_service::worker_args`) | the in-process supervisor — exit **0** is `ExitReaction::Respawn`, no backoff |
//! | `WindowsTask` | the per-user Scheduled Task's action is `run --supervisor task` (`service.rs`) | the **caller**: `<RestartOnFailure>` is a minute away at best, so whoever asked runs `roomlerd service start` once the old process is gone |
//! | `MacosSupervisor` | the FR-43 root daemon spawns `run --supervised` | the root daemon's poll loop, any exit, ≥ 1 s later |
//! | `Launchd` | `XPC_SERVICE_NAME` is one of OUR labels (`com.roomler.*`) | launchd — `KeepAlive{SuccessfulExit:false}` relaunches a **non-zero** exit only |
//! | `Systemd` | `INVOCATION_ID` is set AND this process sits in one of OUR units' cgroups | systemd — and at request time the unit's EFFECTIVE policy is read back (`systemctl show`) before anything exits |
//!
//! Hence two exit codes ([`Supervision::restart_exit_code`]): `0` under the
//! SCM, whose supervisor already treats a clean exit as "come straight back",
//! and [`crate::watchdog::RESTART_REQUESTED_EXIT_CODE`] everywhere else,
//! because launchd reads a `0` as "done, stay down".
//!
//! ⚠️ The two rows backed by the environment need more than the variable.
//! `INVOCATION_ID` alone is inherited: on a GNOME desktop every terminal is a
//! child of `gnome-terminal-server.service`, so a shell there carries a valid
//! `INVOCATION_ID`, and a hand-run `roomlerd run` from it would have read as
//! "systemd will restart me". The cgroup names the unit, and only our own unit
//! names count, by exact name. That still says nothing about what a drop-in did
//! to the unit's `Restart=`, nor whether this process is the unit's MAIN
//! process (the only one systemd restarts) rather than something the daemon
//! spawned — so [`systemd_restarts`] reads both back from systemd itself before
//! a restart is accepted. `XPC_SERVICE_NAME` is likewise set for every
//! LaunchServices app (`application.com.apple.Terminal.…`, or plain `0`),
//! hence the label prefix; a child of the job inherits it too, but a child of
//! a launchd job cannot outlive it as the device's only daemon (launchd kills
//! the job's process group), so the worst an inherited label can do is restart
//! a second, redundant daemon.
//!
//! The Windows flags and FR-43's `--supervised` are argv, which no child
//! inherits; they are only ever passed by the spawners above (both are hidden
//! flags — a person passing one by hand is lying to the daemon about who will
//! bring it back). [`detect_here`] ignores each outside its own platform.
//!
//! [`detect`], [`decide_restart`] and [`systemd_restarts`] are pure — every
//! input is a parameter — so the whole policy is a unit test on every
//! platform, including the two that have no CI test lane.
