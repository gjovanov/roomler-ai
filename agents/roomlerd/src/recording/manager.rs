//! FR-85 P2a — the daemon's side of a LOCAL recording: it launches
//! `roomlerd record` for the LocalAPI verbs, follows its events, and answers
//! "what is recording, and how did the last one end".
//!
//! The recorder stays a process of its own (a driver fault costs it, never the
//! daemon); this is only its supervisor. One recording at a time. A daemon
//! that goes away closes the child's stdin, which the child reads as
//! `parent_gone` and finalizes — a recording never outlives its launcher.
//!
//! FR-85 P1e — the recorder runs as the person signed in at the device, at
//! normal integrity ([`super::launch`]): an elevated worker hands it a
//! restricted medium copy of its token, a SYSTEM one the console user's. The
//! daemon's own work in the recordings folder (listing, deleting, serving a
//! download) runs as that same identity ([`RecordingManager::as_user`]), and
//! the folder is decided by the recorder, as the recorder (`record --where`).
