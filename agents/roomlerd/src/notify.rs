//! Needs-attention sentinel — daemon-side surface.
//!
//! P3e lever E: the sentinel machinery (paths, raise/read/clear, reasons)
//! lives in `roomler-node-core::notify` so thin clients (the desktop
//! companion) can read it without linking this crate. Everything is
//! re-exported here under the old paths. What could NOT move is the rc.53
//! worker-aware trio below: it probes the process's worker role via
//! [`crate::system_context::worker_role`], which is winlogon-token machinery
//! gated on the daemon-only `system-context` feature.

///
/// When the current process is the LocalSystem SCM worker
/// ([`crate::system_context::worker_role::WorkerRole::SystemContext`])
/// the standard `directories::ProjectDirs` `%APPDATA%` resolves to
/// `C:\Windows\System32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Roaming\…`
/// — invisible to a human operator and missed by every fleet-mgmt
/// scanner that greps user profiles. Prefer
/// `%PROGRAMDATA%\roomler\roomler-agent\needs-attention.txt` in that
/// case so the file is findable by both a logged-in operator
/// (`dir %PROGRAMDATA%`) AND a fleet scanner.
///
/// Returns `(path, was_machine_global)` so the caller can log the
/// resolved location at WARN — operators investigating "where did
/// the sentinel land?" find it via the log line.
///
/// On non-Windows, builds without the `system-context` feature, or
/// when the worker-role probe fails, falls back to the existing
/// per-user [`attention_path`] semantics.

/// "system-context"`) mirrors the gate on the upstream module —
/// `pub mod system_context;` is itself `#[cfg(feature =
/// "system-context")]` (`lib.rs`). Without both, the LocalSystem
/// branch is dead code that wouldn't link, so we route through the
