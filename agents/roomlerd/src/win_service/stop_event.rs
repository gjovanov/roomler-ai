//! #1683 — the graceful-stop channel between the Windows SCM service host and
//! its worker.
//!
//! The service host stops its worker with `TerminateProcess`
//! ([`super::supervisor::OwnedProcess::terminate`]). A hard kill delivers no
//! console control event and never trips the worker's `terminate_signal()`, so
//! the worker never reaches its `os_initiated_stop` arm — which means an
//! **ephemeral** device installed as the SCM service never self-unenrolls on a
//! clean stop (only the server-side reaper collects it, after the TTL), and a
//! deliberate stop is miscounted toward `crash_count` on the next start (the
//! #1040 wall, on Windows). FR-51 promised a clean stop self-unenrolls in
//! seconds; that worked on Linux (SIGTERM) only.
//!
//! The fix is a named Win32 **manual-reset** event that the host creates BEFORE
//! it spawns each worker and signals on SCM stop / preshutdown: the host asks
//! the worker to leave gracefully, waits a bounded time
//! ([`super::supervisor::WORKER_GRACEFUL_STOP_BUDGET`]), and only then falls
//! back to `TerminateProcess`. The worker's Windows `terminate_signal()` waits
//! on the same event and, when it fires, takes the exact `os_initiated_stop`
//! arm a Unix SIGTERM takes.
//!
//! ## The worker POLLS — it never parks a blocking task on the event
//!
//! [`wait_for_stop_event`] probes the event with `WaitForSingleObject(h, 0)`
//! every [`STOP_EVENT_POLL`] between plain tokio sleeps. That shape is
//! load-bearing. The worker's shutdown `select!` has other arms — an update's
//! internal shutdown, FR-84 D3's requested restart — and they win by DROPPING
//! this future. `main()` then drops the runtime at the end of its `block_on`,
//! and a runtime drop waits for every `spawn_blocking` task to *return*. A
//! blocking wait that could only return on the host's signal would therefore
//! have held process exit hostage: the worker never left on an auto-update, and
//! a requested restart never landed. Here the handle lives inside the future
//! and closes on drop, so nothing outlives a lost select; the ≤ 250 ms of
//! latency is invisible against the host's 8 s budget.
//!
//! ## Security — why the DACL is load-bearing
//!
//! The worker may run as **SYSTEM** (SystemContext) or as the **signed-in user**
//! (the attended flavour). If any local user could *signal* this event, any
//! local user could stop a SYSTEM worker — a denial-of-service, and for an
//! ephemeral device an unenroll-by-anyone. So the event carries an explicit,
//! protected DACL ([`STOP_EVENT_SDDL`]):
//!
//! * **SYSTEM** (the host) gets `EVENT_ALL_ACCESS` — it created the event and is
//!   the only principal that may `SetEvent` it.
//! * **Interactive users** get `SYNCHRONIZE` only — enough to *probe*
//!   ([`WorkerStopEvent::is_signaled`]), never enough to signal. `SYNCHRONIZE`
//!   (`0x100000`) does not include `EVENT_MODIFY_STATE` (`0x2`), so a second
//!   interactive user (fast-user-switch), or the worker itself, can wait but
//!   cannot stop anyone.
//!
//! The name is unique per spawn (host PID + a monotonic counter), so a restart
//! never opens a stale, possibly-already-signaled handle. The host cannot use
//! the worker PID in the name — it must create the event before the worker
//! exists — so per-spawn uniqueness stands in for "per worker": each spawn gets
//! a fresh event, fresh name, fresh handle, torn down with the worker.
//!
//! Everything degrades safely: if the event cannot be created the worker spawns
//! anyway (the shutdown path just hard-terminates, exactly as before this
//! change), and if the worker cannot open/probe the event it falls through to
//! `std::future::pending()` (today's behaviour), so the host's bounded wait
//! simply times out into the `TerminateProcess` fallback. The server-side
//! reaper remains the backstop for every exit that never reaches self-unenroll.
//!
//! Whether a stop that DID arrive may unenroll the device is a separate, pure
//! decision — `crate::updater::should_self_unenroll` — because the MSI's own
//! service stop during an update must never read as the device leaving.
