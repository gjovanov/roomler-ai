//! FR-138 P2a — the org loop's remote-control sessions, kept through the loss
//! of the control socket.
//!
//! Until this, each connection owned its session map and every way it could
//! end closed every peer in it (`close_all_peers`), so a server roll ended
//! every live session although its pixels never crossed the server. The map now
//! lives in the org loop that redials ([`crate::signaling::run`]) and is lent to
//! each connection. A session in it is either **attached** to the current
//! connection or **kept** (detached) with a hard deadline, waiting for the next
//! connection's claim (`kept_sessions` in the hello), which the server answers
//! with `rc:session.resumed` or `rc:terminate`.
//!
//! Which way a connection ends decides ([`ConnExit::kind`], spec §2.2): the
//! twelve exits that lost only the path keep what can be kept, and the five that
//! ended the process, the machine or the device's standing close every peer,
//! kept ones included. A refused token closes them too (`run`'s `AuthRejected`
//! arm).
//!
//! ⚠️ **Nothing leaves the table except through [`close_within_budget`].**
//! `AgentPeer`'s `Drop` does not close its `RTCPeerConnection`, and a WebRTC
//! peer that is dropped frees nothing: its UDP sockets belong to tasks its ICE
//! agent spawned. A kept peer that is dropped is exactly the leak that once ate
//! a host's ephemeral port range. So every path out of `kept` closes, the table
//! closes what it holds even when it is dropped, and a peer is kept only when
//! three things hold: the device's switch is on ([`survive_enabled`]), the
//! server this connection spoke to announced a window above 0, and the session
//! was live, its peer not dead.
//!
//! FR-138 P2b — on a supervised Mac a delegated session's peer lives in the GUI
//! worker, so the daemon's loop holds a RECORD of it instead ([`Record`]): no
//! peer, but the claim, the deadline and what the server must hear. The worker
//! keeps the peer on a delegated table of its own ([`SessionTable::for_worker`]),
//! driven by the daemon's orders (`Detached`, `Resumed`, `Close`), and closes
//! it there, through the same budget.
//!
//! Off is today: with the switch off, or no window ever announced, every exit
//! closes every peer as `close_all_peers` did, the same order, label and line.
