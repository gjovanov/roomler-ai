//! FR-92 — the keep-busy state machine.
//!
//! Pure: every OS fact arrives through [`Host`], so the whole decision
//! surface — when to move, when a human is present, when to resume, when to
//! give up — is unit-tested with a scripted fake host and a fake clock. The
//! split is the input arbiter's again (`ArbiterState` vs its worker).
//!
//! ## Who is a real user
//!
//! The engine only ever causes absolute mouse moves, so anything else is a
//! person. Each running tick it looks for, in this order:
//!
//! 1. controller input the arbiter injected since the last tick
//!    ([`Host::remote_epoch`]) — exact;
//! 2. the OS idle clock having moved past the baseline the engine read right
//!    after its OWN last move — a key, a scroll, a click, a moved mouse;
//! 3. the cursor not being where the engine left it.
//!
//! (3) without (2) is not a person — an app warped or confined the cursor —
//! and is reported as `cursor_contended`, with a growing back-off so the two
//! never fight. Hooks, raw input and key polling are deliberately absent:
//! EDR reads each as a keylogger, and a GPO-locked corporate desktop with EDR
//! is in the acceptance bar.
