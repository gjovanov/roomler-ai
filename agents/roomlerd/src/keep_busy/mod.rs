//! FR-92 — keep busy: synthetic mouse patterns that keep a host active, and
//! that any real user takes over at once.
//!
//! An `INPUT` session turns it on from the viewer; the agent then moves the
//! pointer in a pattern so the OS idle clock never runs out (no screensaver,
//! no idle lock, no "Away"). Any real input — the person at the machine or a
//! controller — pauses it; it resumes after `resume_after` of quiet, and
//! stays on across disconnects, self-updates and reboots until switched off.
//!
//! Layout:
//! * [`patterns`] — the shapes, pure geometry;
//! * [`engine`] — the state machine, pure (a `Host` trait carries every OS
//!   fact, so it is unit-tested with a scripted fake);
//! * [`wire`] — `rc:keep-busy.*` on the control data channel;
//! * [`state`] — the per-person store;
//! * this file — the engine's thread and its process-global handle.
//!
//! The engine runs on its own thread and asks the input arbiter — the ONE OS
//! injector — to read and move the cursor. It is never a second injector.
//! See `docs/fr/FR-92-keep-busy.md`.
