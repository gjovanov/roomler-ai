//! Fleet RPC — the agent-side execution engine.
//!
//! Runs ONE bounded shell command on behalf of a `rc:rpc.exec` frame the
//! server has already gated (org kill-switch, caller permission, the device's
//! `ExecPolicy`) and answers with a `rc:rpc.result`.
//!
//! ## What this module is responsible for
//!
//! The server owns *who may ask*. This module owns *what actually happens on
//! the box*, which is four things the server cannot enforce from a distance:
//!
//! * **Gate 4** — the agent's own `exec_enabled` config key. A device owner
//!   can refuse execution even when the server says yes, and that refusal
//!   survives a compromised control plane. Checked by the caller in
//!   `signaling.rs` before we are reached.
//! * **Bounds** — wall-clock timeout, a combined stdout+stderr ceiling, and a
//!   concurrency cap. Re-enforced here rather than trusted from the wire, so
//!   a forged or replayed frame can't ask for an unbounded run.
//! * **Redaction** — output is swept for the agent token, `Bearer …` headers
//!   and JWT-shaped strings BEFORE it leaves the host. Command output is
//!   persisted in `exec_audit`, so a secret a command happens to echo would
//!   otherwise outlive the session by 90 days.
//! * **Process-tree kill** — a timeout or cancel must not leave orphans. On
//!   Windows that's `taskkill /T /F`; on Unix the child leads its own process
//!   group and we signal the group.
//!
//! ## Injection
//!
//! The command is passed as a SINGLE argv element to the shell
//! (`pwsh -Command <cmd>`, `bash -c <cmd>`). There is no string concatenation
//! at the spawn boundary, so nothing the caller writes can escape into the
//! agent's own argv — the shell then interprets it, which is the whole point
//! of the feature.
//!
//! ## Privilege
//!
//! On a perMachine Windows install the daemon runs as SYSTEM; under systemd,
//! as root. Commands inherit that. This is deliberate — `Get-NetFirewallRule`,
//! `netsh`, route tables and service state are exactly what remote diagnosis
//! needs — and is surfaced in the admin UI's opt-in copy rather than hidden.

///
/// * the **literal pass runs over everything visible** (carry + new bytes)
///   before the cut, so a literal that straddles the previous cut is masked
///   the moment it is complete;
/// * a settled prefix ending in `bearer ` is **pulled back** to the word
///   boundary before it — settled alone, `Bearer ` leaves its token to the
///   next chunk, where `mask_bearer` sees no prefix and masks nothing;
/// * a literal that itself contains whitespace (none is registered today)
///   adds a hold-back of its own length.
///
/// # The bounds
///
/// A whitespace-free run longer than [`CARRY_CAP`] (`base64 -w0`, minified
/// JSON, a binary with few whitespace bytes) would grow the carry without
/// bound, so it is **force-settled**: the pattern pass runs over the whole
/// buffer first (a fully visible token straddling the cut is masked anyway),
/// then all but the last max([`FORCED_HOLD`], longest literal − 1) bytes
/// are emitted. A literal can never leak at a forced cut; a pattern token
/// leaks only if more than `FORCED_HOLD` of it is visible and it is still
/// unfinished.
///
/// A prompt with no trailing newline (`Continue? [y/N]`) would otherwise sit
/// in the carry until EOF, so the owner flushes a carry that has waited
/// ([`idle_flush`](Self::idle_flush)) — holding back only a tail that is a
/// proper prefix of a literal, and a `bearer ` context whose token is in
/// progress. A pattern token is then split only if the WRITER pauses
/// mid-token, which a secret written with one `write()` never does.

/// an invalid run on both sides, and no cut lands inside one.
