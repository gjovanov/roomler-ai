//! FR-52 P3b — the device's external-login state: which logins are in flight,
//! how many guesses this device has answered, and which logins verified.
//!
//! [`crate::external_access`] speaks the OPAQUE protocol and nothing else. This
//! module decides who may be answered, how often, and what a verified login is
//! good for. It has no wire and no gates of its own — the caller (P3c's frame
//! handler) checks gate 3 and loads the credential; this is gate 4's *policy*.
//!
//! # The one rule everything here follows
//!
//! **A guess is debited when a KE2 leaves the device — never when a KE3 fails.**
//! In OPAQUE the client learns whether its password is right while opening KE2,
//! before any KE3 exists. A guessing client stops there, so the device never
//! sees a failure. Measured with the real browser library (FR-52 field log,
//! 2026-09-24): wrong password ⇒ the client refused at KE2 and the device saw an
//! abandoned login. A throttle that counted failed KE3s would count nothing.
//!
//! Three consequences, each easy to get wrong in a way that reads as tidying:
//!
//! 1. **Check and debit are one critical section.** If the budget were checked,
//!    the lock released and the debit taken later, an attacker who sends a
//!    hundred KE1s at once gets every one of them past the check before the
//!    first debit lands. [`ExternalLogins::begin`] holds the lock across the
//!    check, the (cheap) OPAQUE step and the debit.
//! 2. **An exhausted budget answers nothing.** A refusal that still carried a
//!    KE2 would still be an oracle.
//! 3. **A success refunds ITS OWN debit, not the streak.** Resetting the count
//!    on any verified login would hand an attacker a fresh budget every time the
//!    legitimate outsider logged in.
//!
//! # What this is not
//!
//! Not DoS protection. Answering KE1 costs the device one OPRF evaluation and a
//! 3DH — the Argon2 is the *client's* cost — so the throttle is tuned for
//! guesses, not CPU. And it is in-memory: a daemon restart forgives the window.
//! An attacker cannot restart the daemon without either local access or a crash
//! bug, and a restart forgives at most one day's worth of guesses; persisting the
//! window is recorded as an open decision in the FR-52 spec rather than done
//! quietly here.
