//! The Windows half of [`crate::pty`] — ConPTY.
//!
//! Windows has no pty pair to open. Instead the console host owns the terminal:
//! [`CreatePseudoConsole`] hands back an `HPCON`, and a process is attached to
//! it by passing that handle through a **process-thread attribute list** on
//! `CreateProcess`. The child then talks to a real console, and the console
//! host renders VT sequences into the pipe we read.
//!
//! Three consequences worth knowing, because none of them have Unix analogues:
//!
//! * **The pipe ends are crossed.** `CreatePseudoConsole` takes the handles IT
//!   will use — the READ end of our input pipe and the WRITE end of our output
//!   pipe — and we keep the opposite ends. Handing it the wrong ones produces a
//!   session that connects and never echoes, which is a miserable thing to
//!   debug.
//! * **We must close our copies of the child's ends** after `CreateProcess`,
//!   exactly as Unix must close the pty slave: while any handle to the write
//!   end survives, our read never reports EOF and a finished session hangs.
//! * **There are no process groups.** Teardown is a job object, so closing it
//!   kills the shell *and everything it started* — the same guarantee
//!   `killpg` gives, obtained differently.
//!
//! # Async
//!
//! Anonymous pipes on Windows are synchronous, and there is no `AsyncFd`
//! equivalent to register them with. Both directions therefore run on
//! [`spawn_blocking`](tokio::task::spawn_blocking) threads with a small channel
//! in front — the same shape the Unix pumps have, one layer lower. A session is
//! two blocking threads; sessions are counted in single digits, so that is a
//! fair trade against the complexity of overlapped I/O on named pipes.
