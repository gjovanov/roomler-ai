//! M3 A1 SYSTEM-context capture pump.
//!
//! Bridges the M3 A1 backends ([`DxgiDupBackend`] + [`GdiBackend`])
//! behind the existing [`crate::capture::ScreenCapture`] trait, so
//! `peer.rs::media_pump` consumes one uniform interface regardless of
//! which worker context is running. The user-context worker keeps
//! using the WGC / scrap backends; the SYSTEM-context worker (chosen
//! at startup via [`super::worker_role::probe_self`]) uses this.
//!
//! ## Lifecycle
//!
//! 1. [`SystemContextCapture::primary`] spawns a dedicated OS thread
//!    (because both [`DxgiDupBackend`] and [`GdiBackend`] are `!Send`
//!    on Windows — D3D11 / GDI handles have thread affinity).
//! 2. The thread first calls [`super::desktop_rebind::attach_to_winsta0`]
//!    (idempotent — required so `OpenDesktopW` for `Default` /
//!    `Winlogon` is reachable from the SCM-spawned worker).
//! 3. Then [`super::desktop_rebind::try_change_desktop`] binds the
//!    thread to whichever desktop currently receives input — usually
//!    `Default` at startup, may flip to `Winlogon` after a `Win+L`.
//! 4. Builds a [`DxgiDupBackend`] against the primary monitor.
//! 5. Loops on capture commands from the async side (via
//!    `oneshot::Sender<CaptureReply>`) until the channel is dropped.
//!
//! ## BackendBail routing (matches RustDesk's
//! `video_service.rs:851-856` trip-wire convention):
//!
//! | Bail variant | Routed to |
//! |---|---|
//! | `Transient` | `Ok(None)` — no frame this tick (idle-keepalive will fire upstream) |
//! | `DesktopMismatch` | `try_change_desktop` rebind, then `Ok(None)` |
//! | `AccessLost` | `DxgiDupBackend::reset()`, then `Ok(None)` |
//! | `SessionGone` | `Err(...)` — terminal, supervisor tears down |
//! | `HardError` (×3 consecutive) | swap to GDI fallback |
//! | `HardError` (1-2 consecutive) | log + `Ok(None)` |
//!
//! After GDI takes over, every successful GDI frame *also* re-tries
//! DXGI on the next tick — we want to climb back to the GPU path as
//! soon as it recovers (driver reset, hybrid GPU re-enumeration). On
//! GDI-also-failing, return `Err(...)` and let `media_pump` rebuild
//! the entire pump.
