//! Roomler desktop (`roomler-desktop`) — the node stack's control
//! surface. Tauri 2, lives in the system tray, one window with a
//! sidebar SPA (`src/front/`): Overview / Devices / Tunnels /
//! Settings / Onboarding + the remote-control consent modal.
//!
//! Architecture:
//! - The desktop app is a **thin client**: live node/peer/flow/route
//!   state comes from the running daemon over the LocalAPI
//!   (`roomler_localapi::Client`); consent decisions go the same
//!   way (P2b — the daemon owns the profile-correct sentinel dir).
//! - Enrollment goes through `roomler_node_core::enrollment::enroll` as a
//!   direct lib call (no subprocess).
//! - Service control / self-update shell out to the daemon CLI
//!   (`roomlerd service install`, `roomlerd self-update`).
//! - Closing the window HIDES it (close-to-hide below) — the tray icon
//!   and the consent watcher must outlive the window, since surfacing
//!   consent prompts is this app's safety-relevant job.
//!
//! See `agents/roomler-desktop/Cargo.toml` for the dep wiring (the
//! package keeps its historical name; the output binary is
//! `roomler-desktop` since P3d).
