//! Authenticode verification for anything the agent is about to EXECUTE.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! The self-updater downloads an installer and runs it as the daemon's
//! identity — **SYSTEM under the perMachine service, root under systemd**. Its
//! only integrity check was a size floor plus a SHA256 that is verified *when
//! the manifest carries one*, and that digest travels in the SAME manifest,
//! from the SAME origin, as the download URL. That makes it a corruption
//! check, not a tamper anchor: anyone able to serve the manifest (a
//! compromised release proxy or PoP, a stolen release token, a TLS-terminating
//! middlebox) rewrites the URL and the digest together and every agent
//! installs their payload. A SYSTEM-launched MSI raises no SmartScreen or UAC
//! prompt, so nothing else stands in the way.
//!
//! The fix is to verify a signature that the serving channel cannot forge,
//! against an expectation compiled into this binary. Windows releases are
//! Authenticode-signed by the publisher below (Azure Artifact Signing, and the
//! release workflow's `require` gate fails a release tag that would ship
//! unsigned), so the check is enforceable today.
//!
//! ## What is checked, and why both halves are needed
//!
//! 1. `WinVerifyTrust` — the file carries a valid, trusted, unrevoked
//!    Authenticode signature (chain + timestamp).
//! 2. The signer's common name contains [`EXPECTED_PUBLISHER`].
//!
//! Step 1 alone is **not** sufficient and it is the trap worth naming: it
//! proves only that *somebody* the machine trusts signed the file, and every
//! commercial code-signing certificate chains to a root Windows already
//! trusts. An attacker holding any such certificate would sail through. The
//! identity check is what makes the signature mean "this came from us".
//!
//! ## Platforms other than Windows
//!
//! `verify_publisher` reports [`Unsupported`](VerifyError::Unsupported) off
//! Windows. The Linux `.deb` and macOS `.pkg` ship detached GPG `.asc`
//! signatures, but verifying those needs the release public key pinned in this
//! binary, which is a separate change — the caller decides what to do with an
//! unsupported platform, and today it keeps the previous behaviour rather than
//! blocking updates on a check that cannot run.
