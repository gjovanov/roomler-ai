//! Cross-session "controller is currently connected" signal between
//! the user-context worker and the SCM-supervisor.
//!
//! ## Why a marker file
//!
//! The plan §4 originally specified an inherited anonymous pipe
//! (`STARTUPINFOEX::lpAttributeList` + `PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_HANDLE_LIST`)
//! between supervisor and worker. That's the architecturally pure
//! design but it's ~200 LOC of Win32 FFI plus handle-life-cycle bugs
//! to debug.
//!
//! This module ships a smaller equivalent: a lock-file at a stable
//! path that any process can stat. The file's mtime is the heartbeat
//! — fresh mtime means a controller is currently connected; mtime
//! older than [`PRESENCE_MAX_AGE`] means stale (worker crashed mid-
//! session, controller disconnected without graceful shutdown, etc.).
//!
//! Tradeoffs vs. the inherited-pipe design:
//! * **Pros**: zero Win32 FFI, ~50 LOC, ProgramData ACL handles
//!   cross-session visibility for free, recovers automatically from
//!   worker crashes.
//! * **Cons**: 5-second polling granularity means a worker that
//!   crashed exactly between heartbeats can leave a stale signal for
//!   up to [`PRESENCE_MAX_AGE`] before the supervisor notices. The
//!   browser's auto-reconnect ladder (0.2.0) closes that gap from
//!   the operator's side: the controller will see a brief
//!   "Reconnecting..." chip and the next supervisor cycle re-spawns
//!   under whichever role is currently appropriate.
//!
//! ## Path
//!
//! `C:\ProgramData\roomler-agent\peer-connected.lock` — under
//! `%PROGRAMDATA%`. Both the user-context worker (running as the
//! interactive user) and the SCM service (running as `LocalSystem`)
//! can read and write here:
//! * `LocalSystem` is admin-equivalent for ACL purposes — full
//!   access by default on every Windows install.
//! * The interactive user inherits `Users:Modify` on subdirectories
//!   created beneath `%PROGRAMDATA%` via the standard CreatorOwner
//!   ACL on `C:\ProgramData`. The `create_dir_all` call below
//!   relies on that inheritance.
//!
//! On non-Windows the path falls back to `/tmp/roomler-agent/`.
//! The non-Windows path is for development / testing only — no
//! cross-session semantics are needed there.
//!
//! ## Wire format
//!
//! Empty file. The mtime is the only signal. Worker rewrites the
//! file's content (overwrite, not append) every 5 s while the
//! WebRTC peer is in `Connected` state, so the mtime advances on
//! every heartbeat. On peer transition to `Disconnected` /
//! `Closed` / `Failed` the worker calls [`signal_disconnected`]
//! which removes the file. The supervisor's
//! [`is_signaled`] returns `false` for both "file doesn't exist"
//! and "file is too old".
