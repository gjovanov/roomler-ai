//! `SetThreadDesktop` rebind primitives for the M3 A1 SYSTEM-context
//! input thread.
//!
//! ## Lifecycle
//!
//! When the SCM-launched LocalSystem service spawns a SYSTEM-in-
//! session-N worker via [`super::winlogon_token::spawn_worker_as_system`],
//! that worker starts in the SCM's **window station**
//! `Service-0x0-3e7$` (the noninteractive Session 0 winstation).
//! Every `OpenDesktopW("Default" | "Winlogon")` call from there
//! returns `ERROR_NOACCESS` because those desktops live under
//! `WinSta0`, not the SCM's. So the worker MUST first call
//! [`attach_to_winsta0`] before doing any desktop work — that's a
//! one-time bootstrap step at process startup, idempotent if the
//! process is already on WinSta0.
//!
//! Once attached to WinSta0, the worker's input thread runs a
//! [`try_change_desktop`] check before each SendInput dispatch. The
//! function calls `OpenInputDesktop()` to learn which desktop
//! currently receives input, compares to the desktop the thread is
//! already attached to, and `SetThreadDesktop`-switches if they
//! differ. This is the lazy-rebind pattern from RustDesk
//! `windows.rs:935-956` — instead of polling for desktop changes we
//! react to them at the natural granularity of input dispatch.
//!
//! ## Why a dedicated input thread
//!
//! `SetThreadDesktop` is per-thread. Tokio's work-stealing executor
//! distributes tasks across worker threads non-deterministically, so
//! an input task that did `SetThreadDesktop` on one tokio worker
//! could find itself running on a different worker on the next
//! poll, with the wrong desktop binding. The M3 A1 input pump is
//! therefore a dedicated `std::thread` that owns the binding, fed
//! by a `tokio::sync::mpsc` channel from the WS handler.
//!
//! ## What `try_change_desktop` returns
//!
//! [`DesktopChange`] carries the result so callers can decide
//! whether to bail-on-change (the capture pump does this — a
//! desktop swap means the captured frame is stale and the encoder
//! needs to flush) or just keep going (the input thread does this —
//! the next event will land on the new desktop). The string-typed
//! `Switched(String)` arm carries the new desktop name for logging
//! / surfacing to the browser via the `rc:desktop_changed` control
//! message.
//!
//! ## Failure modes
//!
//! `OpenInputDesktop` returns `Ok(None)` on access-denied (DACL or
//! winstation-not-attached). Under the SYSTEM-context worker that's
//! a hard error — the supervisor's contract is "you're SYSTEM, you
//! see Winlogon"; if the call fails the M3 A1 path can't proceed.
//! [`try_change_desktop`] surfaces this as `Err` so the input thread
//! can exit and let the supervisor respawn.
//!
//! `SetThreadDesktop` fails when the calling thread owns hooks /
//! windows (the OS forbids switching while you're a window owner).
//! The M3 A1 input thread never creates windows, so this should
//! not fire — surface as `Err` if it does.
