//! Win32 desktop wrappers for the M3 SYSTEM-context capture path.
//!
//! Background. A Windows session has multiple "desktops" within it.
//! The user's normal interactive surface is `winsta0\Default`; the
//! Windows logon UI (lock screen, password prompt, UAC consent) lives
//! on `winsta0\Winlogon`. A given thread is attached to exactly one
//! desktop at a time and can only capture / inject input on that
//! desktop. The user-context worker the M2 supervisor spawns lives on
//! `Default` and cannot follow focus to `Winlogon` (the Winlogon DACL
//! denies access to non-SYSTEM principals).
//!
//! M3's job is to add a SYSTEM-context capture+input path that polls
//! the *input desktop* (the desktop currently receiving keyboard +
//! mouse input) and `SetThreadDesktop`-switches to it on each change.
//! These wrappers are the building blocks.
//!
//! Feature gate: this module is `pub(crate)` and the `system-capture-
//! smoke` CLI subcommand surfaces it for the spike binary. The
//! supervisor wires it in once the spike confirms WGC capture works
//! from session 0 on a real Win11 box (M3 derisking step per the
//! 2026-05-02 critic review).
