//! Pseudo-terminals for Roomler SSH interactive sessions (P4).
//!
//! Everything before this ran through [`crate::exec`], which buffers a
//! command's whole output to enforce its ceiling and hands it back when the
//! process ends. That is the right shape for `ssh <node> <command>` and the
//! wrong shape for a shell: an interactive session has to stream both ways,
//! immediately, with no ceiling — the output IS the interaction.
//!
//! So a PTY session deliberately does NOT go through the exec engine, and
//! therefore does not inherit its output cap or its wall-clock timeout. It
//! keeps the parts that still make sense: the identity model ([`crate::exec::RunAs`],
//! via the same `apply_run_as` every other path uses) and process teardown.
//!
//! # Two implementations, one surface
//!
//! The mechanisms have nothing in common — Unix opens a pty pair and `exec`s
//! into the slave; Windows asks the console host for a pseudoconsole and hands
//! it to `CreateProcess` through an attribute list. What they share is the
//! shape the SSH server needs, so both expose exactly:
//!
//! * [`PtyProcess::spawn`] — start a shell on a new terminal, as `run_as`
//! * [`PtyProcess::read`]  — one chunk of output; `Ok(0)` = session over
//! * [`PtyProcess::wait`]  — the exit status, in SSH's unsigned form
//! * [`PtyProcess::kill_group`] / `Drop` — nothing outlives the session
//! * [`PtyHandle::write_all`] / [`PtyHandle::resize`] — the input + control
//!   half, usable from a different task than the output pump
//!
//! `ssh.rs` therefore has ONE code path. Keeping the two platforms behind one
//! surface is deliberate: an interactive session is where a divergence would be
//! least visible and most annoying, and a per-platform SSH handler would have
//! grown two subtly different privilege and teardown stories.
