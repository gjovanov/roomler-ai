//! P8b stage 2 — the keyframe-force policy machine.
//!
//! The pending-force lifecycle used to live as five loose locals in
//! each DC pump (`kf_pending_since`, `last_force_rebuild`,
//! `kf_backstop_logged`, `resync_pending`, `was_locked_last_iter`),
//! with the ordering and the two field-regression guards (the rc.234
//! metronome, the rc.217 rebuild churn) enforced only by comment.
//! [`KeyframeGate`] owns that state behind intent-named transitions;
//! the pumps stay the executors (they hold the encoder and write the
//! logs — the gate never does either). Zero behavior change: every
//! method is a 1:1 relocation of a pump touch point, and the
//! regression guards are locked by the tests at the bottom instead of
//! tribal knowledge.
//!
//! What deliberately did NOT move:
//! - the settle keyframe (`rate_profile::SettleKeyframeGate`) — already
//!   its own machine;
//! - the VP9 pump's lock handling — it substitutes an overlay FRAME and
//!   requests the IDR through the shared `keyframe_requested` atomic (a
//!   different shape from the ffmpeg pump's direct lock-edge force);
//! - the `keyframe_requested` atomic itself — shared session infra, the
//!   gate only sees its consumed value;
//! - the VP9 scene-change detector — packet-size heuristics, vp9-only.

/// blurs every ~3 s then re-sharpens" pulse (2026-07-25, NEO16 viewing
/// PC50045/REGAL) on every codec. Wedge safety is preserved without the
/// metronome: rc:keyframe rides the RELIABLE control DC (can't be lost in

/// pict_type, `vp9_qsv` evidently does neither), so a browser resync request

/// answers the force well inside this window and the rebuild becomes a true
