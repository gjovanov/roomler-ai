//!
//! Deliberately separate from [`crate::ssh`], which is the SERVING side. That
//! module only exists in builds with an overlay feature (no overlay ⇒ no
//! address to serve SSH on), but the answer to a request we originated arrives
//! on the plain control WS and must be deliverable in ANY build — so the
//! waiter registry lives here, ungated.
//!
//! Mirrors `exec::expect_response` exactly: register a oneshot under the
//! request id BEFORE sending, hand the receiver to the caller, and let a guard
//! deregister on drop so an abandoned caller cannot leak a slot that a later
//! id could be delivered into.
