//! Windows multimedia timer resolution.
//!
//! By default a Windows process runs at the *system* timer resolution,
//! which is **15.6 ms (≈64 Hz)** unless some process on the machine has
//! requested finer. Every `tokio::time::sleep`, every timer-park wakeup,
//! and — critically — every cross-thread reschedule that lands while a
//! tokio worker is parked in `park_timeout` is therefore quantized to
//! ~15.6 ms boundaries.
//!
//! For the SystemContext capture path this is catastrophic. The FFmpeg
//! DataChannel pump (`peer::media_pump_ffmpeg_dc`) paces with a
//! `tokio::time::sleep` floor and a *tiny* HW encode (vp9_qsv / hevc_qsv
//! ~4 ms), so the loop spends most of each frame parked on a timer. With
//! 15.6 ms granularity the floor sleep AND the per-frame capture oneshot
//! round-trip (`SystemContextCapture::next_frame`: mpsc cmd → worker
//! thread → scrap `frame()` 0.85 ms → oneshot reply → tokio reschedule)
//! both round *up* to 15.6 ms ticks. Field data (PC50054, 2026-05-30)
//! showed the round-trip ballooning to ~45 ms/frame under motion despite
//! the worker-side scrap call measuring 0.85 ms — i.e. ~44 ms was pure
//! timer/scheduler quantization. Result: ~12 fps under motion.
//!
//! The slow libvpx VP9-4:4:4 pump (`media_pump_vp9_444_dc`) never hit
//! this: its 40-120 ms *CPU-bound* SW encode keeps the worker thread hot
//! and off the timer, so the 15.6 ms quantization is a small fraction of
//! its much longer loop. That is why the HW (vp9_qsv, 4 ms encode) path
//! was paradoxically *slower* (12 fps) than the SW (libvpx, 80 ms encode)
//! path (15-25 fps) on the same host.
//!
//! `timeBeginPeriod(1)` drops the resolution to 1 ms — the exact call
//! RustDesk, OBS, and Chrome (during media playback) make for precisely
//! this reason. Held for the process lifetime via [`TimerResolutionGuard`];
//! the matching `timeEndPeriod` runs on drop (best-effort — process exit
//! restores the default anyway).
//!
//! Scope note: on Windows 10 2004+ `timeBeginPeriod` is per-process, so
//! this does not raise the global system timer rate for other processes.
//! A session-0 / background process *can* have its request ignored under
//! aggressive power throttling (EcoQoS); if the field heartbeat's
//! `avg_capture_ms` does NOT drop after this ships, the follow-up is a
//! `SetProcessInformation(ProcessPowerThrottling, …IGNORE_TIMER_RESOLUTION)`
//! opt-out. We ship the standard call first and let the heartbeat tell us
//! whether the opt-out is needed.
