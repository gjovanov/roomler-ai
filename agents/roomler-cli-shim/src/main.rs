//! `roomler.exe` on daemon hosts — a launcher that re-execs `roomlerd cli`.
//!
//! # Why
//!
//! Both MSI flavours used to bundle the full standalone tunnel CLI next to the
//! daemon (P4b). Measured on rc.361 that was 22.1 MiB of which only ~1.2 MiB
//! was CLI-specific code: `cargo bloat` puts `roomler_cli` + its bin at
//! 1.16 MiB of a 15.0 MiB `.text`, and everything else (std, the webrtc
//! family, tunnel_core, tokio, rustls, reqwest, quinn, clap) is a second copy
//! of crates `roomlerd.exe` already links. It also cost the Windows MSI job a
//! serial 143 s `cargo build -p roomler-cli` with a different feature set.
//!
//! So the daemon now owns that command surface (`roomlerd cli <args>` →
//! `roomler_cli::cli::run_from`), and this ~150 KB launcher keeps the
//! user-facing `roomler` command, its PATH entry, and the installer-smoke
//! payload assertions exactly where they were. Tunnel-ONLY hosts are
//! unaffected — they still install the real standalone binary from
//! `release-tunnel.yml`.
//!
//! # Behaviour notes
//!
//! * stdio is INHERITED, so streaming verbs (`roomler exec`, `roomler run`)
//!   behave identically to the standalone binary.
//! * Ctrl-C is deliberately ignored HERE so the child owns it. Windows
//!   delivers CTRL_C_EVENT to every process in the console group; if this
//!   launcher took the default action it would exit first and leave the
//!   long-running child (`roomler run`, `roomler forward`) orphaned. Unix is
//!   the same story with SIGINT/SIGQUIT and the foreground process group —
//!   parent ignores, child resets to default in pre_exec (P3e Phase 2: the
//!   .deb ships this launcher as /usr/bin/roomler on daemon hosts).
//! * The child is located next to this executable rather than via PATH, so a
//!   different Roomler install elsewhere on PATH can never be dispatched to.
