<!-- FR-120 P1 — a chip whose explanation is a tap away.

     A chip's `title` reaches only a mouse: on a touch screen a tap does not
     show it, so what the chip means ("needs a person, and why") was
     unreachable on a phone. This chip opens its explanation in a small menu on
     a tap or click, at every width, and keeps the `title` for a mouse's hover.

     Attributes (size, colour, variant, prepend-icon, data-testid, class) land
     on the chip. A chip whose tap already does something (opens a dialog that
     explains) stays a plain `v-chip`: its tap path is that action. -->
