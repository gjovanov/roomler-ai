    // non-OWNER in the org — including its admins, since DEFAULT_ADMIN
    // deliberately excludes that bit — was logged out by opening the page.
    // The store had a `catch` that carefully left the switch `null`; it never
    // ran on the branch that mattered, because the logout fired one layer
    // below it, before the throw. Three fail-closed nav predicates in
    // `utils/permissions.ts` exist only to route around this rule, and each
    // was written after the same bug in a different corner (analytics,
    // invites, now enrollment keys). The rule was the defect.

    // tenant at all, and the SERVER says which it is (`ApiError::NotAMember`
    // ⇒ `error: "not_a_member"`) rather than the client guessing from a
    // message string — `chat`'s "Not a member of this room" is a 403 with the
    // same shape and must not evict anyone from their org.
    //
    // ⚠️ Default direction matters more than either branch: an UNCLASSIFIED
