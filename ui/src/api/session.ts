 * ## This is a HINT, not a credential
 *
 * The credential is an `HttpOnly` cookie that JavaScript cannot read, which is
 * the entire point: script that runs on this page cannot steal it. What script
 * still needs is a synchronous answer to "should I render the app or the login
 * page", so a hard refresh on a protected route does not flash the login form
 * while `/auth/me` is in flight.
 *
 * So this flag grants nothing. Setting it by hand in devtools gets you an app
 * shell whose every request 401s. The server is the only thing that decides.
 *
 * ## Why it is not the token
 *
 * Until this landed the SPA kept the access token (7 days) AND the refresh
 * token (30 days) in `localStorage`, where any XSS could read them — and the
 * refresh token re-mints access tokens, so that one was a month of durable
 * account access that survived a password change and a logout. Those are gone;
 * [`clearLegacyTokens`] removes what earlier versions left behind.
