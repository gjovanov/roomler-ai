 * OPAQUE (RFC 9807) with `@serenity-kit/opaque`, which is the device's own
 * opaque-ke compiled to WebAssembly. Three messages cross the server, which
 * relays them blind: it never sees the password, nothing it could attack
 * offline, nothing it could replay. What a successful login leaves behind is
 * held HERE, in memory, for one session:
 *
 * - the `attemptId` the server and the device both know it by;
 * - the `appKey` derived from the session key the two ends share and nobody
 *   else ever saw — what seals this page's offer and checks the device's answer.
 *
 * ⚠️ A wrong password is decided in this browser, at KE2, and the device never
 * hears a failure — but the attempt still cost it a guess (spec §4b). So the
 * page must not retry a login on its own: every retry is a guess.
