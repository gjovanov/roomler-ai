 * FR-22 part 4 — persist each connect attempt's marks.
 *
 * Parts 1–3b put the eleven connect marks in the console and the verdict in
 * a snackbar. Both live exactly as long as the tab does. The 2026-09-25 field
 * read found what that costs: the server records three of the eleven marks
 * (`remote_audit`), every stall it could see had aged past the pod-log and
 * `agent_logs` windows, and a stall in `requesting` leaves no server row at
 * all — so the phase a stall died in, the one fact the marks exist to
 * capture, was recorded nowhere. `agent_logs` held ZERO browser rows because
 * the `/api/log/browser` route had never been given a caller.
 *
 * This is that caller. One record per attempt, posted when the attempt ends
 * — first paint, a phase bound firing, the operator cancelling, or the ladder
 * advancing past it — into `agent_logs` as a `browser`-source batch with one
 * line, `target: "rc.connect"`, so a stall's phase is mineable server-side
 * within the same 7-day window as the agent's own logs.
 *
 * ⚠️ Best effort, by construction. Nothing here may touch the session: the
 * POST is fire-and-forget, every failure (network, 401, 403, 429, 5xx) is
 * swallowed, and it deliberately bypasses `api/client.ts`, whose 401 handler
 * would try a token refresh and log the operator out, and whose 429/5xx
 * handlers raise a snackbar. A diagnostic must never become the incident.
 *
 * ⚠️ Timing metadata only. The `msg` is the same per-step line the console
 * prints (mark names and millisecond deltas) and `fields` carries ids,
 * booleans and numbers. No URL, no token, no message text, no hostname —
 * the record is about WHEN, never about WHAT.
 *
 * ⚠️ Rate-capped below the API's per-IP governor (60 req/min). One attempt
 * produces one POST, never a retry, and a flapping ladder that abandons an
 * attempt every few seconds is capped by `RC_CONNECT_UPLOAD_MAX_PER_MIN` —
 * dropping a record is the right failure, since a diagnostic that throttles
 * the API it shares with the session would be measuring its own damage.
