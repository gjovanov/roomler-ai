 * FR-125 P1 — immersive landscape on phones. While a session runs on a touch
 * page held sideways and under {@link IMMERSIVE_MAX_HEIGHT} px tall, the app
 * bar, the viewer's toolbar and the session tools strip step aside and the
 * stage takes the whole page; a pull-tab brings the toolbar back as an overlay,
 * so the stage never resizes (a resize re-sends `rc:resolution`).
 *
 * Measured on production before it (2026-10-26): the bars left the remote
 * desktop 146–254 px on a phone held sideways, and every built-in touch preset
 * ran off the top. The viewer decides; the app shell only reads
 * {@link immersiveViewer} to hide its bar. The helpers are pure, so a spec
 * drives them at every size.
