 * #1631 — the `:key` for the component a `<router-view>` renders
 * (`components/layout/KeyedRouterView.vue`).
 *
 * `undefined` for every route without `meta.remountOn`. Vue treats a missing
 * key as "the same element", which is Vue Router's default reuse across a
 * param change — and what the views that rewrite `route.query` in place via
 * `router.replace` (the devices grid's kind filter, the ACL tabs) depend on.
 * Keying on `fullPath` would remount those on every filter flip, and
 * ChatView watches `roomId` itself. A route that names a param remounts when
 * THAT param changes and only then: `agent-remote:A` → `agent-remote:B` is a
 * new view; `agent-remote:A` with a different query is not.
