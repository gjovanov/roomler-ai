 * FR-97 P0c — what a device says it cannot serve, and why.
 *
 * A word in the hello is a promise (FR-97 §3.1). Where a host cannot keep one,
 * the agent takes the word out of its lists and names the feature in
 * `AgentCaps.unavailable` (feature → `{code, reason}`), and the viewer shows
 * that reason on the control instead of a control that fails silently.
 *
 * - Whether a control WORKS still follows the lists, exactly as before: an
 *   empty `audio` list already disables the audio toggle. This map adds the why.
 * - `not-applicable` is the one code that HIDES a control: the feature means
 *   nothing on that OS (Ctrl+Alt+Del on a Mac). That is how the viewer adapts
 *   to the OS without ever reading `agent.os`.
 * - An agent before P0c sends no map, and an absent key never means
 *   "unavailable".
 *
 * Pure functions only, so the parsing and the rules are unit-tested without a
 * session.
