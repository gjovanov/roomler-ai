 * costs nothing at steady state.

 * Hops measured:
 *  - `fwd`    — main-thread DC `onmessage` → worker `chunk` arrival
 *               (epoch-absolute clocks via `epochNowMs`, valid across
 *               contexts because both sides use timeOrigin + now()).
 *  - `decode` — `decoder.decode(chunk)` submission → `output` callback
 *               (queue + decoder latency; indicts the decoder itself).
 *  - `paint`  — the `paintFrame` body (canvas blit cost).
 *
 * Also home to the 2D-context A/B options: `alpha:false` enables the

 * low-latency canvas swap chain (may be a no-op for placeholder-composited
 * OffscreenCanvas — which is exactly why it ships as an A/B, not an
