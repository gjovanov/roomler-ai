 * FR-17 stages A + C — the receive half of per-chunk framing, with a
 * bounded reorder buffer.
 *
 * The agent splits each frame into 16 KiB DataChannel messages. Before
 * FR-17 those messages were a bare byte stream: the receiver concatenated
 * them and trusted SCTP's reliable+ordered guarantee to deliver every one,
 * in order, forever. That guarantee is exactly what stage B gives up — an
 * unordered / partially-reliable channel is what stops one lost chunk from
 * head-of-line-blocking every frame behind it (`send_wait_max` hit
 * 10,263 ms in the field on a healthy agent).
 *
 * A byte stream cannot survive that, because a receiver has no way to tell
 * "the next 16 KiB of this frame" from "the first 16 KiB of the next one".
 * So each message carries an 8-byte prefix:
 *
 *   bytes [0..4)  frame_seq,   u32 little-endian
 *   bytes [4..6)  chunk_idx,   u16 little-endian
 *   bytes [6..8)  chunk_count, u16 little-endian
 *
 * ## Stage C — why in-order assembly was not enough (FR-59 P7)
 *
 * Stage A's assembler required chunk `n+1` to follow chunk `n`. Under an
 * ordered channel that is free; under stage B's UNORDERED one it is
 * wrong in the common case, not the rare one: chunk 2 of a frame routinely
 * arrives before chunk 1, and the strict rule read every such frame as a
 * break. The result was a keyframe request per frame — worse than the
 * head-of-line blocking stage B exists to remove. That is why the FR
 * recorded stage C as "blocked on a reorder buffer".
 *
 * So a frame is now assembled into SLOTS indexed by `chunk_idx`, in any
 * order, and emitted whole the moment every announced slot is filled.
 * Reordering within a frame is therefore invisible.
 *
 * ⚠️ Emission is whole-frame rather than per-chunk. That costs no latency:
 * the byte assembler downstream cannot decode a partial frame either, so
 * the decode still happens on the last chunk — the only difference is
 * where the bytes waited.
 *
 * ⚠️ A frame still incomplete when a NEWER one COMPLETES is abandoned,
 * with a gap reported. Holding it would re-introduce exactly the
 * head-of-line delay the unordered channel exists to remove, and it would
 * buy nothing: the codec is delta-chained, so a frame whose predecessor
 * never arrived is undecodable anyway and the gap is what asks for the IDR
 * that repairs the chain.
 *
 * ⚠️ At most [`MAX_PARTIAL_FRAMES`] frames are held. Unbounded buffering
 * on a lossy link is a memory leak with a slow fuse: every frame that
 * loses a chunk would be retained forever, on the exact link where frames
 * lose chunks.
 *
 * ⚠️ This module is deliberately SHARED by both workers rather than copied
 * into each. The rule "what counts as a gap" has to be one function: FR-10
 * shipped a spacing rule that lived in one of its two call sites and the
 * other one silently didn't have it, which is the defect this file's
 * existence is meant to prevent.
