 * FR-138 P1c (#3604) — a paint path's half of `rc.resume`'s `gap_ms`: how far
 * the first frame painted after a cut came after the last frame painted before
 * it.
 *
 * A held session's pixels never cross the server, so on a direct or TURN
 * carrier the picture should not notice a server roll at all, and AC2 reads
 * that as "no gap above 500 ms in the frames the viewer paints across the
 * roll". The cut is the moment the page starts to hold (its own socket's loss,
 * or `rc:session.detached`). Only the paint path knows when it painted, so each
 * keeps one of these: the data-channel worker and the RTP-transform worker,
 * each on its own `performance.now()`, and the page for the `<video>` path.
 *
 * | Message | Direction | Carries |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | {@link PAINT_GAP_MARK} | page → worker | the cut |
 * | {@link PAINT_GAP_MARKED} | worker → page, at once | `sinceMs`: how long before the cut the last frame was painted, `null` before any |
 * | {@link PAINT_GAP_CLOSED} | worker → page, at the first frame painted after the cut | `gapMs`: from the last frame before the cut to it, `null` when none came before |
 *
 * Both numbers are differences on the paint path's own clock, so a worker's
 * epoch is never compared with the page's (#3566).
 *
 * ⚠️ Record, never decide: nothing acts on these. A worker posts nothing
 * unless the page marked a cut, so a session that never holds sends exactly
 * what it sent before.
