 * FR-135 R1 — a decoder that fails after its first frame recovers in place.
 *
 * Before R1 the composable answered that failure by stopping the worker. On a
 * data-channel session nothing else carries pixels, so the picture froze until
 * the media watchdog re-created the session: 9.4 s and 10.2 s from the error to
 * the next session, measured in FR-132 §8. The spec's bound is 500 ms to the
 * next paint (FR-135 §3.5, §6.8).
 *
 * The worker now builds a new decoder, asks for a key frame, and the
 * leading-delta gate drops deltas until it lands. It builds a new one because
 * WebCodecs closes a `VideoDecoder` when it errors: `reset()` on it throws
 * `InvalidStateError`, so a reset is not available on the path that matters.
 *
 * This module holds only the decision, so the rules can be tested without
 * WebCodecs:
 *
 * ```
 * decoding ──failure──▶ recovering ──output──▶ decoding
 *                        │    ▲
 *                        └────┘ another failure, within the budget
 * ```
 *
 * ⚠️ Three failures are not this module's to answer, and `onFailure` returns
 * false for them so the worker reports the error as before:
 * - Before the first frame. There it means the browser's probe was wrong for
 *   this stream, and the composable bans the transport and renegotiates. A new
 *   decoder would hide that and leave a black page.
 * - With the per-browser kill switch set (`roomler-rc-decode-recover=0`).
 * - Past the budget. A stream this decoder cannot take fails again on every key
 *   frame, so the session goes back to the watchdog's path, which re-creates it.
 */

/** Rebuilds allowed inside `DECODE_RECOVER_WINDOW_MS`. The agent answers at most
 *  two key-frame asks a second, so a stream that kills every decoder uses these
 *  up in a second or two. A fault that recurs more slowly than this keeps
 *  recovering, at a short freeze each time instead of a new session. */
