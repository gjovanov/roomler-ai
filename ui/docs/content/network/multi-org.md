title: One machine in several organizations
description: Put a single machine in more than one Roomler workspace at once — how identity, addressing and host-global settings behave when organizations overlap.

A contractor's laptop belongs to their own workspace and their client's. A build
server serves two teams. One machine, several organizations — supported, with
some rules worth knowing before you rely on it.

## One daemon, not several installs

:::danger Do not install a second copy of the agent
It is the intuitive answer and it does not work. The agent owns things that are
**global to the machine**: one network adapter with a fixed name, one local
control socket, one set of routing and firewall state, one updater. A second
install fights the first over all of them.

One agent, several enrollments, is the supported shape.
:::

## Primary and secondary

The **first** enrollment is the primary. Additional organizations are appended
alongside it.

Anything that is necessarily host-global follows the **primary only**:

| Host-global | Why |
|---|---|
| Software updates | There is one binary on the machine |
| Exit-node routing | There is one default route |
| DNS steering | There is one resolver configuration |
| Anything that binds a port | There is one port |

:::warning A secondary organization's admin cannot change host-global settings
That is the point of the distinction. A machine's owner should not have their
update channel or their default route changed by a workspace they merely
collaborate with.
:::

## Addressing

Each organization has its **own address block**, so the machine holds a separate
address per workspace and traffic is demultiplexed by destination. Its
cryptographic identity is **freshly generated per organization** — never copied
between them, so the same machine cannot be correlated across workspaces by its
public key.

## Adding a second organization

Mint an enrollment token in the second workspace and enroll the machine again.

:::danger A restart is required, and nothing tells you
Joining a second organization does **not** start its connection until the agent
restarts. Until then the device looks enrolled in the dashboard and simply never
comes online.

The tell: in the new workspace the device's last-seen time never advances past
its creation time, while the same machine is plainly online elsewhere. If you see
that, restart the agent.
:::

## Checking which organizations are live

```bash
roomler org ls    # every organization this machine belongs to
roomler status    # connection AND mesh state, per organization
```

:::warning "Connected" and "mesh on" are different claims
An organization can be connected to the control plane with its mesh switched
off, and every surface will otherwise look healthy. `roomler status` prints both
on one line for that reason, and an organization with the mesh off is named in
`roomler peers` rather than silently omitted.

If a second organization has no mesh, turn it on explicitly and restart:

```bash
roomler org overlay <org> tun
```
:::

## Platform limits

- **macOS** does not support a separate network adapter per organization.
- **Exit node** and userspace-networking roles are primary-organization only.

## Removing one

Remove the device in that organization's dashboard, or from the machine:

```bash
roomler org rm <org>
```

Removing a secondary leaves the primary untouched. Removing the primary is the
bigger operation — the machine's host-global settings belong to it.
