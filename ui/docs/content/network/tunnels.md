A **tunnel** forwards a port on the machine you are sitting at to a service on a
machine somewhere else. The service does not have to be on the mesh, or even
know Roomler exists — it just has to be reachable *from* the machine running the
agent.

## The shape of it

```
localhost:5432  ->  [ your machine ]  ==mesh==>  [ remote agent ]  ->  db.internal:5432
```

Nothing is exposed to the internet. The remote service keeps listening only
where it always did.

## Open one

```bash
roomler forward --agent <agent-id> --local 5432 --remote localhost:5432
```

Then use `localhost:5432` with any client you already have — `psql`, a GUI, an
ORM. Nothing needs to know about the tunnel.

:::warning The target is the device's **id**, not its display name
`--agent` takes the hex device id, which you can copy from the device's page in
the dashboard. A friendly name is not resolved here, and passing one fails in a
way that looks like the device is missing.
:::

The command stays in the foreground and tears the forward down on `Ctrl-C`. To
hand it to the local agent instead — so it survives the CLI exiting — add
`--daemon`, then manage it with:

```bash
roomler flows          # every flow the local daemon is running
roomler kill <flow-id> # stop one
```

:::tip `--remote` is the interesting flag
`--remote localhost:5432` reaches a service on the remote machine itself.
`--remote db.internal:5432` makes that machine a **jump host** to something else
it can reach — the database behind the office firewall, the appliance on an
isolated VLAN.
:::

## Permanent tunnels

For a forward you always want, declare it in the agent's configuration instead
of opening it by hand. The agent reconciles declared routes on every start, so
the tunnel comes back after a reboot, and it backs off rather than hammering the
server if one cannot be established.

```bash
roomler route add --agent <agent-id> --local 5432 --remote localhost:5432
roomler route ls
roomler route disable <id>
roomler route rm <id>
```

The tray and menu-bar companion exposes the same list, if you would rather click.

## UDP as well as TCP

Both are supported. UDP forwarding is what makes DNS, game servers and some VPN
protocols work through a tunnel rather than only web and database traffic.

## Who is allowed to open one

:::warning A tunnel is an access-control decision, not a convenience
Every forward is checked against the organization's tunnel policy before it is
established. A machine cannot open an arbitrary path into a network just because
it happens to be enrolled.
:::

Policies name what may be reached, from where, and by whom, and every decision
is recorded. See [overlay ACLs](/docs/security/overlay-acls/) and [device
policies](/docs/security/device-policies/).

## Tunnel, SOCKS5 or SSH?

:::cards
- **Tunnel** icon:terminal — One known port to one known service. The simplest thing that works.
- **[SOCKS5](/docs/network/socks5/)** icon:external — Many destinations, chosen by the client at connect time. Good for browsing an internal network.
- **[SSH](/docs/network/ssh/)** icon:shield — A shell, file transfer, and forwards, on a machine running no `sshd`.
:::

## When a tunnel drops

Tunnels re-establish themselves when a path recovers. If one stays down:

```bash
roomler status
roomler peers      # is the far end reachable at all?
```

If the peer is not reachable, the tunnel is a symptom rather than the problem —
start at [cannot connect](/docs/troubleshooting/cannot-connect/).
