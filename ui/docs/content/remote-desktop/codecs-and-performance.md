Roomler encodes the remote screen as video and decodes it in your browser. Which
encoder it uses depends on the machine's hardware, and it is chosen by
**probing** rather than by guessing.

## Codecs

| Codec | Notes |
|---|---|
| **H.264** | The universal floor. Available everywhere, decodes everywhere. |
| **HEVC** | Better quality per bit; needs support on both ends. |
| **AV1** | Best compression; newest hardware only. |
| **VP9** | Used for the 4:4:4 path, where crisp text matters more than motion. |

A codec is only offered when **both ends** can handle it, so a session always
negotiates down to something that actually works rather than failing.

## Hardware encoders by platform

:::os
@windows
The broadest support of the three. On startup the agent probes what the machine
can really do and advertises only what succeeded.

- **Media Foundation H.264** — the built-in hardware path.
- **NVIDIA, Intel and AMD** encoders for H.264, HEVC and AV1 where the GPU and driver provide them.
- **Software** (openh264) as the always-available floor.

Force one if you need to:

```powershell
roomlerd run --encoder hardware   # try hardware first
roomlerd run --encoder software   # skip hardware entirely
```

@macos
:::warning Encoding is software-only on macOS today
The hardware-encoder dispatch covers NVIDIA, Intel and AMD; **VideoToolbox is
not wired up**, so Apple Silicon encodes in software (openh264 for H.264,
libvpx for the VP9 4:4:4 path).

It works well for normal desktop use. It is a real limit for high-resolution,
high-motion content, and it is stated here rather than left to be discovered.
:::

@linux
NVIDIA, Intel and AMD hardware encoders are used where the driver provides them,
with software as the floor.

The agent's capability probe runs in a **separate process** on purpose: a
graphics driver that faults while being probed then takes down the probe rather
than the agent. Before that, a bad driver could restart the agent straight back
into the same probe — a crash loop rather than a degraded machine.
:::

## Why a probe rather than a list

Reporting a codec as available because the hardware *ought* to support it is how
you get a session that negotiates a format and then produces nothing. The agent
therefore encodes an actual frame with each candidate at startup and advertises
only what worked.

## When a session feels slow

Work down this list — it is ordered by how often each one is the answer.

:::steps
1. **Check the connection indicator.** If it reads **Relay**, the path is the problem, not the encoder. A relayed pair is bandwidth-capped by design. See [cannot connect](/docs/troubleshooting/cannot-connect/).
2. **Check what the far end is doing.** A machine pinned at 100% CPU encodes slowly no matter which encoder it picked.
3. **Set priority to Responsiveness.** Trades sharpness during motion for input latency.
4. **Reduce the resolution at the far end.** A 4K desktop is four times the pixels of 1080p, and on a software encoder that is the whole budget.
5. **Try forcing hardware encoding** on Windows or Linux, in case the probe fell back for a reason worth knowing.

:::tip "Slow" almost always means "relayed"
Across a lot of field measurement, the overwhelmingly common cause of a sluggish
session is a pair that fell back to a relay — very often because a VPN client on
one end captured the local network range. The same two machines on a direct path
are typically an order of magnitude better. Check the indicator first.

## Browser-side decoding

The viewer uses a **low-latency decode path** in Chromium that bypasses the
video element's built-in buffering.

:::warning Why Chromium specifically
A normal `<video>` element enforces a jitter buffer of roughly 80 ms regardless
of what you ask for, which is a large share of a remote-control latency budget.
Decoding frames directly and painting them avoids it. That path is a Chromium
capability, which is why the viewer targets Chromium even though the rest of the
product is browser-agnostic.

## What a good session looks like

| Path | Round-trip input latency |
|---|---|
| Same LAN | Single-digit milliseconds |
| Direct across the internet | Roughly the network round-trip, plus encode and decode |
| Relayed | Noticeably higher, and bandwidth-capped |

If a **LAN** pair feels slow, something is wrong and worth reporting. If a
**relayed** pair feels slow, the fix is to get it off the relay.
