This is the whole loop end to end. It assumes nothing except a machine you can
run a command on.

## 1 · Create a workspace

Sign up at [roomler.ai](/register) and give the organization a name your team
will recognise — it labels **every device and every invite** you issue from it.

The free plan covers **three devices** with the private network, remote desktop,
tunnels, chat and calls all included, so nothing below needs a card.

## 2 · Mint an enrollment token

In the dashboard, open **Devices → Enroll device**.

:::warning A token is a credential
An enrollment token is **single-use and short-lived**, and anyone holding it can
join a machine to your organization. Paste it into a terminal, not into a chat
room, and mint a fresh one if it goes astray.

## 3 · Install the agent

Pick your operating system. The graphical installer and the one-line form do the
same thing — the wizard just asks the questions instead of taking flags.

:::enroll
:::

Each platform has a fuller page — service modes, permissions, uninstall — at
[Windows](/docs/start/install/windows/), [macOS](/docs/start/install/macos/) and
[Linux](/docs/start/install/linux/).

## 4 · Watch it come online

Back in **Devices**, the machine appears within a few seconds.

| Status | What it means |
|---|---|
| **Online** | The server holds a live socket to the agent. Everything works. |
| **Stale** | The device is heartbeating, but no server holds its live socket. It self-heals, usually inside about two minutes. |
| **Offline** | No heartbeat. The machine is off, asleep, or has no route to the server. |

If it does not appear at all, the token was probably consumed by an earlier
attempt — mint a fresh one. [Troubleshooting](/docs/troubleshooting/) has the
longer list.

## 5 · Open the screen

Click the device, then **View screen**.

What happens next depends on how the device is configured. By default a machine
**asks the person sitting at it** before handing over the screen, so an attended
machine shows a consent prompt. Your own unattended machines can be set to skip
that — see [unattended access](/docs/remote-desktop/unattended-access/).

:::tip It should feel direct
On a healthy path the session is peer-to-peer and latency is single- to
low-double-digit milliseconds. If it feels sluggish, the pair has almost
certainly fallen back to a relay — [Cannot
connect](/docs/troubleshooting/cannot-connect/) explains how to tell, in one
command.
:::

## 6 · Join it to the private network

Remote desktop works on its own, but the same agent can also put the machine on
your **private mesh**, giving it a stable address and a name that other enrolled
machines can reach directly — no port forwarding, no public exposure.

Once two machines are on the mesh:

```bash
roomler status          # this machine: address, name, carrier
roomler peers           # everything else on the mesh, and how it is reached
```

Then reach one from the other by name or address — a database, an internal web
app, SSH — as if they were on the same LAN. [Private
network](/docs/network/) covers addresses, names, routing and access control.

## Where to go next

:::cards
- **[Your first remote session](/docs/remote-desktop/first-session/)** icon:monitor — Multi-monitor, quality, clipboard and file transfer.
- **[Private network](/docs/network/)** icon:network — Addresses, MagicDNS, subnet routers and exit nodes.
- **[Security & access control](/docs/security/)** icon:shield — Who may reach what, and how to prove it afterwards.
- **[Self-hosting](/docs/start/self-hosting/)** icon:terminal — Run the server yourself.
