heroAlt: Layered access control gating who may reach which machine, with every decision recorded
order: 0

Access control here is **layered and default-deny**, and the layers are owned by
different parties on purpose: an organization, an administrator, a user and the
machine itself each hold a gate, and **any one of them refuses**.

## The one idea worth taking away

:::danger The last gate is always held by the machine
For the most powerful features — remote command execution, SSH, acting as a
relay — the final decision lives in the machine's own configuration, and **the
server cannot write it**.

That is not redundancy. It is the property that makes the whole chain worth
something: if the control plane were compromised, every server-side gate would
fall at once. A gate the server cannot open is the only one that survives that.
:::

The consequence is a real trade-off, stated honestly: turning these features on
requires touching the machine, or explicitly opting that machine in to being
remotely configurable. That is a cost, and it is deliberate.

## Default-deny, everywhere it counts

| Surface | Default |
|---|---|
| Remote commands | Off, at four independent levels |
| SSH | Off, at four independent levels |
| Acting as a relay for others | Off |
| Being an exit node | Off, and needs a separate admin approval |
| Consent for a remote session | **Ask** — an absent setting means ask, not allow |
| SSH port forwarding on a device | Nowhere, until a destination is named |

:::warning An empty list means "nothing", not "everything"
Where the product distinguishes *no policy configured* from *a policy that
permits nothing*, it keeps them distinct. Collapsing the two is how an
access-control system silently becomes permissive.
