title: The connection cascade
description: How two machines choose a path — measured rather than guessed, never ratcheting down, and with a floor over TLS 443 that always connects.

Connectivity is the hardest part of this product, and the design rests on four
commitments. They are worth stating plainly because they explain the behaviour
you will observe.

## 1 · Best path that works, always measured

The ladder — same LAN, direct public, hole-punched, relayed, then a TLS floor —
is not chosen by classifying the network. Both ends **measure** what actually
works and a decision is made from those measurements.

:::warning Heuristics may detect; they never decide
A NAT-type classifier is a useful hint and a terrible verdict. Networks lie:
middleboxes rewrite, VPN clients capture ranges, and "this looks like symmetric
NAT" is wrong often enough that acting on it strands pairs that would have
connected.
:::

## 2 · A floor that always connects

With every UDP path blocked, the mesh still runs over **TLS on port 443** — the
one port that survives essentially every corporate network, because blocking it
blocks the web.

Connectivity is therefore never all-or-nothing. It degrades in quality, not in
availability.

## 3 · Never ratchet down

A pair that falls back to a relay **keeps trying** to get back to a direct path,
permanently. There is no state in which the software has given up.

Upgrades are **make-before-break**: the better path is established before the
worse one is dropped, so improving a connection does not interrupt a live
session.

## 4 · Never self-wedge

Any change to routing, exit configuration or firewall state **pins the paths
that carry the mesh and the control connection first**, and if it cannot, it
**withholds the change** rather than applying half of it.

:::danger This is the rule that keeps a mesh feature from costing you the machine
A feature that reroutes traffic is one mistake away from removing your own
access to the box. Guards re-assert routes continuously — other VPN clients are
known to reap them — and a reconciler heals leftover state after an unclean
shutdown.
:::

## Relays

A relay forwards **ciphertext**. It cannot read what it carries, so putting one
in the path is a performance decision and never a privacy one.

Relays come in three kinds, in increasing order of preference for a given pair:

| Kind | Runs where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **The TLS floor** | The server | Always available; the guarantee |
| **A standard relay** | Ours, or yours | UDP; better than the floor |
| **An organization relay** | A machine **you** own | Your own hardware, your own bandwidth, your own tenancy |

An organization relay is worth knowing about if you have many relayed pairs:
because it is one of your own machines, the traffic stops crossing our
infrastructure at all, and it measurably outperforms the shared path.

:::warning An organization relay engages on a path change, not on the switch
Turning it on does not move an already-healthy pair onto it. A pair sitting
happily on the floor will not re-request until something about its path changes.
If you are testing it, restart one of the two machines to provoke the decision.
:::

## Seeing it

```bash
roomler peers
```

Every peer, and the path currently carrying it. The remote-desktop session shows
the same as **LAN / Direct / Relay**.

## When it does not converge

[Cannot connect](/docs/troubleshooting/cannot-connect/) walks the diagnosis. The
single most common cause is a **VPN client that captured the local network
range**, which strands a pair on a relay while every surface reports normally.
