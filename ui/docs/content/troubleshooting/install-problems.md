## It installed, but the machine never appeared

### The token was already used

Enrollment tokens are **single-use**. If an earlier attempt got far enough to
enroll, the token is spent and the retry fails. Mint a fresh one.

### The wrong server

If you are self-hosting, the machine must be pointed at *your* server. A script
served by your own instance names your origin automatically — but a command
copied from elsewhere may not.

```bash
roomler status    # which server does it think it belongs to?
```

### It cannot reach the server

The agent needs outbound HTTPS and no inbound ports. From the machine:

```bash
curl -sI https://roomler.ai/health
```

Failing here is a network problem — proxy, firewall, DNS or captive portal.

## Antivirus or endpoint protection blocked it

:::tip Installers are served through the product's own origin for exactly this reason
Downloads come from `roomler.ai` (or your own server) rather than from GitHub,
so a corporate allow-list only has to trust one hostname. If yours blocks the
download, allow-list that origin and retry.
:::

Every Windows binary is Authenticode-signed by **G ROX LTD**, and Linux/macOS
artifacts carry GPG signatures and build provenance — useful evidence when
asking a security team for an exception. See [signed
releases](/docs/security/signed-releases/).

## Per-OS

:::os
@windows
**"Access denied" partway through.** A machine-wide install registers a Windows
service and needs administrator rights. Run from an elevated PowerShell.

**Installed, but not reachable at the lock screen.** That is the service mode,
not a failure. Re-install with `-Role daemon-system`.

**A previous version will not uninstall.** Remove it from *Settings → Apps* and
retry. If a manually-registered service is in the way:

```powershell
roomlerd service uninstall
```

@macos
**The Mac shows as two devices.** Expected — the root half is its own
enrollment. See [Install on macOS](/docs/start/install/macos/).

**The Mac is missing from `roomler peers` entirely.** You installed the user half
only. Add the root half by re-running with a second token as `--daemon-token`.

**Everything installed, screen is wallpaper.** A privacy grant, not an install
problem — see [black screen](/docs/troubleshooting/black-screen/).

**"daemon not running".** You are probably talking to the wrong half. Try with
and without `sudo`.

@linux
**Installed, but shows offline.** Check the unit is enabled and that the machine
has outbound HTTPS:

```bash
pgrep -x roomlerd
journalctl -u roomler -n 50 --no-pager
```

:::danger Do not judge by `systemctl is-active` alone
A perfectly healthy daemon can be one systemd does not own, and `is-active` then
reports **inactive**. Check `pgrep` and `roomler peers` before restarting
anything.
:::

**A restart loop.** Look for **two** enabled units trying to run the same agent.
The tell is a service perpetually in an auto-restarting sub-state.

**Manual package install seemed to do nothing.** `dpkg -i` replaces the file
without restarting the service — so the version command reports the new build
while the old one is still running. Restart the unit.
:::

## Uninstalling cleanly

Each OS has its own steps on its install page. Two things people forget:

:::steps
1. **Remove the device in the dashboard.** That is what revokes the credential and releases the mesh address.
2. **On macOS, clear the privacy grants.** They are bound to the binary you deleted, so a fresh install otherwise shows a toggle that is on but attached to nothing.
