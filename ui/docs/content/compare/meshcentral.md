title: Roomler vs MeshCentral
description: An honest comparison against the closest self-hosted predecessor — what MeshCentral does better, and where a peer-to-peer mesh changes the shape.

MeshCentral is the closest thing to a direct predecessor: self-hosted,
agent-based, browser-based remote control of a fleet, free and open source
(Apache-2.0).

:::tip If you already run MeshCentral and it works
This page is unlikely to move you, and that is a reasonable outcome.

## What MeshCentral does better

:::cards
- **Breadth of fleet management** icon:blueprint — Hardware inventory, power control, out-of-band management, software deployment, terminal, file manager, device groups. A genuine RMM surface; Roomler's fleet features are narrower.
- **Maturity** icon:check — More than a decade of production use, an enormous documentation corpus, and a long tail of solved deployment problems.
- **Protocol breadth** icon:external — RDP, VNC and SSH relayed through the web interface, reaching devices that will never run its agent.
- **Apache-2.0 throughout** icon:book — No licence split and no commercial edition to reason about. Simpler than Roomler's AGPL server if any copyleft is a problem for you.
- **Runs on very little** icon:terminal — It will live happily on hardware where Roomler's stack would not.

## Where Roomler differs

### A private network, not just a management channel

MeshCentral relays a session **to** a device. Roomler puts the device **on a
mesh**: a stable private address, a name, direct peer-to-peer paths between the
devices *themselves*, port forwards, SOCKS5, exit nodes and SSH with no `sshd`.

Two enrolled machines can talk to each other **without the server in the path at
all** — which a hub-and-spoke model does not do.

### The server is not in the data path

MeshCentral relays sessions through the server by design. Roomler's sessions are
peer-to-peer and end-to-end encrypted, falling back to a relay that forwards
ciphertext only when no direct path can be found.

That is a bandwidth-and-cost difference at fleet scale, and a trust difference at
any scale.

### The remote-desktop path is built for interactive work

Hardware encoding with a probe-and-rollback cascade, adaptive rate control, and a
browser decode path that bypasses the roughly 80 ms of buffering a normal video
element enforces — aimed at dragging windows, not just reading a screen.

### Chat, rooms and video calls

On the same server and accounts.

## Side by side

| | Roomler | MeshCentral |
|---|---|---|
| Self-hosted | Yes | Yes |
| Browser-based control | Yes | Yes |
| Session path | **Peer-to-peer** | Relayed through the server |
| Private mesh between devices | **Yes** | No |
| RDP / VNC / SSH relaying to third-party devices | **No** | Yes |
| Hardware inventory, power control, OOB | **No** | Yes |
| Chat and video | **Included** | No |
| Licence | AGPL server / MPL agent | Apache-2.0 |
| Maturity | Young | Very mature |

## Choosing

:::steps
1. **You want an RMM** — inventory, power control, out-of-band management → MeshCentral.
2. **You need to reach devices that will never run an agent**, via RDP or VNC relaying → MeshCentral.
3. **You want the devices to reach each other**, not just be reachable from a console → Roomler.
4. **Server bandwidth or a server-in-the-path trust concern matters** → Roomler's peer-to-peer sessions.
5. **Any copyleft is a procurement problem** → MeshCentral's Apache-2.0 is simpler.
