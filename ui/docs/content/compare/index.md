title: How Roomler compares
description: Honest head-to-head comparisons against Tailscale, RustDesk, TeamViewer, MeshCentral and NetBird — each naming what the other product does better, first.

Roomler occupies two categories at once — a browser-based remote desktop **and**
a WireGuard-style overlay network, on one agent, one identity and one server you
can host yourself. So the honest comparison is rarely against a single product.
It is against the **stack** most people assemble.

- **[vs NetBird](/docs/compare/netbird/)** icon:shield — Open-source mesh with SSO.

## The short version

Every one of those products is **better than Roomler at the thing it was built
for**. They have more years, more users, more platforms and more polish in their
own lane, and each page below says exactly where — first, before anything else.

What none of them does is **both lanes on one agent**.

:::warning Running two products is not the same as running one that does both
If you run Tailscale *and* RustDesk you are running two agents, two control
planes, two identity systems and two audit trails on every machine — and the
remote-desktop half has no idea the mesh exists.

Roomler is one daemon that is simultaneously the remote-desktop target, the mesh
node, the tunnel endpoint and the SSH server. The machine you just connected to
is already reachable by address and name.

## How these pages are written

Each begins with **what the other product does better**, in plain terms and
without hedging, because a comparison that does not is not worth reading. If
your problem is squarely in another product's lane and none of the differences
matter to you, the honest recommendation is to use that product — and each page
says so.
