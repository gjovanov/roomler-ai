## What RustDesk does better

:::cards
- **Maturity in remote desktop** icon:check — Years of production use and an enormous install base. Its viewer and codec paths have been beaten on by far more people and more hardware than Roomler's.
- **Native clients everywhere** icon:monitor — Desktop viewers plus **iOS and Android**. Roomler's viewer is a browser tab: nothing to install, but also no native mobile app.
- **A large community** icon:book — Translations, and a decade of accumulated recipes.
- **Simplicity of scope** icon:flag — It does one thing. If that is the one thing you need, a smaller product is a feature.

:::tip If your problem is "I need to see and control a remote screen"
RustDesk solves exactly that, and solves it well.

## Where Roomler differs

### A private network comes with it

RustDesk gives you a screen. Roomler gives you a screen **and** the machine, on
a stable private address with a name — so a port forward, a database connection
or an SSH session needs no second product and no second agent.

That is the whole difference in one sentence: after a RustDesk session you still
cannot reach the machine's services.

### Nothing to install on the viewing side

Any Chromium browser is the viewer. That matters on a machine you do not
control — a client's laptop, a locked-down desktop, a borrowed computer.

### Licensing is settled and written down

The server is AGPL-3.0, the agent MPL-2.0, and the split is documented with what
it means if you intend to offer the product as a service. The agent's licence is
deliberately chosen so that a managed-service provider can ship it.

### Supply-chain hygiene as a shipped property

Windows installers are Authenticode-signed and the publisher name is checked by
the updater — not just the signature's validity. Linux and macOS artifacts carry
GPG signatures against a key **pinned inside the binary**, plus build provenance.
The updater also binds the artifact's own version to the version claimed, so a
tampered manifest cannot roll a fleet back onto a signed older build.

### Fleet operations

Enrolment, per-device policy, remote command execution and SSH, with four
independent default-deny gates on the powerful ones and every decision audited.

## Choosing

:::steps
1. **You need a mobile viewer** → RustDesk. Roomler has none.
2. **You want the most proven remote-desktop stack** → RustDesk.
3. **You want the machine reachable, not just visible** → Roomler.
4. **You are supporting people on machines you do not control** → Roomler; there is nothing for them to install.
5. **You need one agent, one identity and one audit trail** → Roomler.
