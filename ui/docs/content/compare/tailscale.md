## What Tailscale does better

Be clear-eyed about this before reading anything else.

:::cards
- **Maturity and scale** icon:check — Years of production use across an enormous fleet, with the operational record only time produces. Roomler is young.
- **Platform coverage** icon:monitor — iOS, Android, Synology, QNAP, routers, embedded. Roomler's agent is Windows, Linux and macOS, and its viewer is Chromium-first.
- **Public ingress** icon:external — Publishing a service to the public internet from a node is a first-class Tailscale feature. Roomler has **no equivalent** — its tunnels reach *into* your network from your own devices.
- **Identity integrations** icon:shield — SSO, SCIM provisioning, device posture, and the breadth of IdP support enterprise procurement asks for.
- **Ecosystem** icon:book — A large community, many published recipes, and integrations with things you already run.

…and none of the differences below matter to you, **Tailscale is an easy
recommendation and you should use it.**

## Where Roomler differs

### Remote desktop is not an add-on

It is the other half of the product. With Tailscale you get a machine on a
network and then still need something to see its screen — VNC, RDP, RustDesk,
another agent. With Roomler the machine you just reached is already viewable in
a browser tab, under the same identity, with the same audit trail.

### The whole control plane is open source

The server is AGPL-3.0 and the agent MPL-2.0, and self-hosting is a supported
first-class path rather than a separate product tier. Tailscale's coordination
server is not open source; Headscale is a community reimplementation rather than
the thing Tailscale runs.

### SSH with no `sshd` and no bound port

Tailscale SSH is excellent and does the same job on Unix. Roomler's also serves
**Windows**, and it binds no port at all — packets are intercepted below the
socket layer, so there is nothing for endpoint security software to terminate
and nothing listening even locally.

### Chat, rooms and video calls are included

On the same server and the same accounts, rather than as a separate product with
its own identity system.

## Side by side

| Capability | Roomler | Tailscale |
|---|---|---|
| Private mesh | Yes | Yes |
| Remote desktop | **Built in** | No — bring your own |
| SSH without `sshd` | Yes, incl. **Windows** | Yes, Unix |
| Exit nodes | Yes | Yes |
| Subnet routers | Yes | Yes |
| Public ingress | **No** | Yes |
| Chat and video | **Included** | No |
| Self-host the control plane | **Yes, same code** | Community reimplementation |
| Mobile apps | **No** | Yes |
| SSO / SCIM | **No** | Yes |
| Maturity | Young | Mature |

## Choosing

:::steps
1. **You need mobile, public ingress, or enterprise SSO** → Tailscale. These are real gaps, not soft ones.
2. **You need a private network *and* remote desktop** → Roomler, or you are running two agents forever.
3. **You must host the control plane yourself, on the real code** → Roomler.
4. **You want the most battle-tested mesh available** → Tailscale.
