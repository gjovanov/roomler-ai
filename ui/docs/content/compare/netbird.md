description: An honest comparison against the open-source overlay mesh with the best self-hosting story — what NetBird does better, and the one structural difference.

NetBird is the open-source overlay mesh that has done the best job of making
self-hosting a first-class path rather than a reverse-engineered afterthought.
On the networking pillar it is the closest comparison to Roomler, and it is a
good product.

## What NetBird does better

:::cards
- **Maturity on the mesh** icon:check — Shipping steadily for years, with a real team, a large user base, and the operational record that follows.
- **Identity** icon:shield — SSO and IdP integration, groups, and policy built around them. Roomler has OAuth sign-in but **no SSO or SCIM provisioning**, and that is a genuine gap for an organization of any size.
- **Platform coverage** icon:monitor — Clients across more platforms including mobile, plus a Kubernetes operator and container-friendly deployment patterns.
- **Self-hosting polish** icon:terminal — Official interface, coordinator and clients as one supported stack, with a well-worn install path.
- **Ecosystem** icon:book — More recipes, more integrations, more people who hit your problem first.

:::tip If your requirement is "an open-source Tailscale replacement with SSO"
NetBird is the direct answer and you should evaluate it seriously.

## Where Roomler differs

### Remote desktop is in the same daemon

This is the whole difference. NetBird gives you the network; seeing a screen is
then a separate product with its own agent, control plane and permissions.

Roomler's daemon is simultaneously the mesh node, the remote-desktop target, the
tunnel endpoint and the SSH server — so a desktop session, a port forward and a
shell share **one enrolment, one access model and one audit trail**.

### SSH that also serves Windows

With no `sshd` and no bound port, on Windows as well as Unix.

### Chat, rooms and video calls

Included on the same server and accounts.

## Side by side

| | Roomler | NetBird |
|---|---|---|
| Private mesh | Yes | Yes |
| Exit nodes, subnet routes | Yes | Yes |
| Remote desktop | **Built in** | No — bring your own |
| SSH without `sshd` | Yes, incl. **Windows** | No |
| SSO / SCIM | **No** | **Yes** |
| Mobile clients | **No** | Yes |
| Kubernetes operator | **No** | Yes |
| Chat and video | **Included** | No |
| Self-host the control plane | Yes | Yes |
| Maturity | Young | More mature |

## Choosing

:::steps
1. **You need SSO or SCIM provisioning** → NetBird. This is a real gap in Roomler, not a soft one.
2. **You need mobile clients or a Kubernetes operator** → NetBird.
3. **You want the network *and* the screen from one agent** → Roomler.
4. **You want the most mature open-source mesh** → NetBird.
5. **You are choosing a stack rather than a product** → count the agents you will be running in a year.
