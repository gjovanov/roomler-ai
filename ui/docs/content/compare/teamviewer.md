## What TeamViewer and AnyDesk do better

:::cards
- **Two decades of polish** icon:check — Enormous install base, refined clients, and an operational record only time produces.
- **Every platform** icon:monitor — Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, ChromeOS, embedded and appliance builds.
- **Attended-support workflow** icon:video — Session handoff, meeting integration, and the "read the ID to me over the phone" flow refined over many years.
- **Enterprise procurement** icon:book — Certifications, support contracts, and a vendor an enterprise's purchasing department already knows.
- **Cross-org access without pre-arrangement** icon:external — Helping a stranger by reading an ID and a password to each other. **Roomler cannot do this today** — both machines must be in the same organization.

:::tip If your job is ad-hoc support for people outside your organization
TeamViewer's model fits that directly and Roomler does not yet. That gap is
tracked openly rather than glossed over.

## Where Roomler differs

### No commercial-use detection

The single most common complaint about the free tier of the incumbents is being
flagged as a commercial user and locked out mid-session, with a slow appeals
process. Roomler's plans are counted by devices and users, and there is no
heuristic deciding whether you look like a business.

### Price shape

Per-user pricing with a generous device count, rather than per-seat pricing that
climbs with concurrent sessions. And a free tier that is genuinely usable rather
than a trial.

### You can host the whole thing

Not a "private cloud" SKU — the same code, on your own machine, with nothing held
back. See [self-hosting](/docs/start/self-hosting/).

### The server never sees the session

Pixels, keystrokes, clipboard and files travel directly between the two ends,
encrypted, or through a relay that carries only ciphertext. That is a property of
the topology, not a promise about behaviour — and self-hosting makes it moot
anyway.

### It is also a private network

The same agent puts the machine on a WireGuard-style mesh, so after the session
you can still reach its services by address or name — a database, an internal web
app, SSH — without a second product.

### Open source

Server AGPL-3.0, agent MPL-2.0. The agent's licence is deliberately chosen so a
managed-service provider can ship it.

## Side by side

| | Roomler | TeamViewer / AnyDesk |
|---|---|---|
| Remote desktop | Yes | Yes |
| Viewer install needed | **No — a browser** | Usually |
| Mobile clients | **No** | Yes |
| Commercial-use detection | **None** | Yes, and a common complaint |
| Self-hostable | **Yes, same code** | Enterprise tier / limited |
| Private mesh network | **Built in** | No |
| SSH / tunnels | **Yes** | No |
| Help a stranger with an ID + password | **No** | Yes |
| Open source | **Yes** | No |
| Maturity | Young | Very mature |

## Choosing

:::steps
1. **You support strangers ad hoc** → TeamViewer or AnyDesk. Roomler needs both machines in one organization.
2. **You need mobile clients** → the incumbents.
3. **You were flagged as a commercial user on a free tier** → Roomler has no such mechanism.
4. **You want your own machines reachable, not just viewable** → Roomler.
5. **You need to host it yourself on the real code** → Roomler.
