 * FR-59 (#1165) — the ONLY render-blocking script on a docs page, and it
 * is ~300 bytes.
 *
 * OS tabs are CSS-only (radio + :checked), so the first panel in DOM order
 * — Windows — is what renders before any JavaScript runs. On a Getting
 * Started page the install command is above the fold, so a macOS reader
 * with a stored preference would watch the wrong OS paint and then swap.
 *
 * This sets `data-os` on <html> BEFORE first paint; `docs.css` honours it
 * with a small override block, and `docs.js` removes the attribute once it
 * has checked the real radios, handing control back to the CSS-only
 * mechanism. Net effect: no flash, and the tabs still work with JS off
 * (no attribute is ever set, so the radios decide, exactly as they do now).
 *
 * ⚠️ Must stay dependency-free and synchronous. Wrapped in try/catch
 * because localStorage THROWS (not returns null) in a browser configured
 * to block site data, and an exception here would abort head parsing.
