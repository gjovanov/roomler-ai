 * The product demo: real machines, one browser tab, each desktop full screen.
 *
 * For each device in `E2E_DEMO_DEVICES` (display names, in order) the take
 * opens its remote page with the sidebar collapsed, presses Connect, waits for
 * the desktop to paint, and enters the viewer's fullscreen, so the machine
 * fills the frame. `scripts/record-demo.sh` cuts the result into the README
 * MP4 and GIF; captions and the title cards are added there, not here.
 *
 * ⚠️ The capture is the DevTools screencast, NOT Playwright's `video` option.
 * Playwright encodes its video at a fixed ~1 Mbit/s VP8, which turns a remote
 * desktop's text into mush at any size worth showing; the screencast hands
 * over every composited frame as a JPEG at the quality we ask for, with its
 * timestamp, and the cut is encoded once, at the end, from those.
 *
 * ⚠️ NOTHING may touch page JS while the screencast films a painting stream:
 * `evaluate`, `boundingBox` and every locator query hang rather than answer —
 * four takes of the earlier demo were lost to checks that could never return
 * while the desktop streamed perfectly. With the screencast PAUSED they answer
 * at once (2026-10-06, every query of the record probe), so it is the capture
 * that starves them, not the page. Geometry is taken BEFORE Connect or inside a
 * pause; otherwise it is CDP input only, and even input then waits ~100 ms per
 * event (see `drag`). That is why "connected" is read from the screencast (a
 * painted desktop is a far heavier JPEG than the connecting page) rather than
 * asked of the page.
 *
 * ⚠️ The fullscreen button exists only once the session is connected, and
 * until then the SAME spot holds Disconnect. Clicking there on a guess would
 * end the session it was meant to show, so the click happens only after the
 * paint is seen; a device that never paints is filmed in the page instead.
 *
 * ⚠️ Nothing filmed may name the org or the fleet. The device list, the
 * dashboard and the network pages all do (machine names, MagicDNS names, other
 * people's devices), so the take never visits them: it goes straight to each
 * device's own page, where the header shows only its name (relabelled, see
 * LABELS), the OS and the version.
